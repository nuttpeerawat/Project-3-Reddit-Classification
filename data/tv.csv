So...since I can’t make a 2nd season magically appear out of thin air, I would love some suggestions.

I would love some good, lighthearted series with some charismatic characters and a “feel-good” approach.
I usually love light/positive comedies, some of my favorites are Friends, Brooklyn Nine-Nine, The Office, Parks and Recreation, Schitt’s Creek, Greek, Scrubs. 
Romance appreciated but absolutely not necessary.

For reference I’ve already watched (as general comedies): Community, The League, New Girl, The Big Bang Theory, Modern Family, Blue Mountain State, How I Met Your Mother, That 70s Show, 30 Rock, Seinfeld, The Good Place, Beaver Falls, Joey, Superstore, Kim’s Convenience, A.P. Bio, Freaks and Geeks, Happy Endings, The King of Queens, Mythic Quest: Raven’s Banquet

I’m looking for something of the same ilk. Where people work together to find solutions and characters go through a lot of development.

I barely watch tv so even popular Tv shows are ok as recs - I’m in the mood for a more serious show with an interesting plot (drama, sci fi, crime, fantasy, mystery) that has a lot of emotion in it. 

Something I really liked about The 100 was how the women were not over sexualized, no one said any explicitly sexual remarks, men are not shirtless for the sake of it, and most romance developed because of emotional connections rather than sex, so basically I prefer shows without an R rating in that aspect.

,televisionsuggestions,"Looking for that one special show again that gives me a ""just one more episode"" kind of feeling, rather than just being something to pass time with. Luckily I haven't watched too many series in my life, so even if something is an obvious thing everyone has seen, it might be a worthy recommendation for me.  
  
Important: No comedy stuff, I'm more into darker things. Ideally something that ends strong and not something that was great for 5 seasons and then fell apart.
  
**Good examples:**  
  
1. **Game of Thrones:** Great mixture of political scheming and strong characters having to overcome personal demons, I especially loved Tyrion's arc and the way Peter Dinklage portrayed him.  
2. **Breaking Bad:** A clever way of making a criminal story have heart and meaning  
3. **The Haunting of Hill House:** An example of a show that shines so much with its characters that they alone carried it even without a strong pulling narrative. I absolutely loved the horror symbolism and how intimate the show felt.  
4. **Three Kingdoms (2010):** The political scheming felt even better than in GoT due to strong relations of the different kingdoms giving it great dynamics. Characters were super intriguing, though not as much compared to GoT. Still enough to root for them though and an example being stronger on the ""tension side"" can work for me as well.  
5. **The Walking Dead (early seasons):** The tension came from the character's personalities, so that was a formula that worked great for me. However, it dragged on too long and I gave up on the series at some point.  
  
**Negative examples:**  
  
1. **Queen's Gambit:** Following a narcissistic know-it-all just predictably crushing through everyone made me not sympathize with main character and offered 0 tension. Even the ""personal issues"" parts didn't work for me as the presentation didn't feel intimate (last episode was better regarding that...but it was the last episode).  
2. **The Expanse:** Granted I only watched 6 episodes and am planning to finish the first season at least. But what I've seen so far mostly fell apart with what I'd consider weak characters. They seem pretty one-dimensional and I'm not really having strong feelings in any direction for any character, barely even remember their names. Political scheming seems weak because there is no real interaction, just someone saying ""x did y, we can't let that happen"".  
3. **The Haunting of Bly Manor:** No apparent main narrative so that episodes just pass by without progressing anything meaningful. Most characters didn't have much depth to offer regarding story or acting. Owen and Hannah were a big exception here but couldn't save the show for me as mere side characters.

Really enjoying this show. Watched a few episodes back in 2016 but stopped watching it (Started binging another show). Cut to now, I am already on Season 3 after starting it again two days ago. It's got a likeable cast, each episode is enjoyable, and it's just an overall funny show.

&lt;p&gt;Really enjoying this show. Watched a few episodes back in 2016 but stopped watching it (Started binging another show). Cut to now, I am already on Season 3 after starting it again two days ago. It&amp;#39;s got a likeable cast, each episode is enjoyable, and it&amp;#39;s just an overall funny show.&lt;/p&gt;

1. The logic must be good. This means all the clues provided throughout the movie should be inter-connected and should be explained at the later stage how they are connected either directly or indirectly.
2. The movie must appreciate the complexity of human's mind and try to explore different scenarios why people commit crime. It's not as simple as personal A hates person B so person A kill person B.
3. The detective / main protagonist must rely on him/herself to solve the case. This means that the character relies on intuition, logical deduction, reading body language and gathering information to solve crimes, instead of relying on technology like having a computer AI or a full team of nerds in the back office (I just don't like it).
4. Preferably, one case should span several episodes. I don't think that one episode of about 40 minutes runtime is enough for a good case. There should also be an overarching story line that covers each season.

Somethings I'd like to avoid is teen drama CW type shows and things that are very old (60s and earlier) but I am open minded. Sequals, spinoffs, tv series or anything with a long run time would be prefered.


My needs of content in order of importance are:

1) a steampunk/dieselpunk/art deco visual aesthetic

2) political theory like faulty socialist and libretarian ideology. Very akin to an Ayn Rand novel

3) an isolationed, claustrophobic, meloncolic, post apolocyptic or dystopian feeling

4) intresting and creative technology or technological advancements

5) Horror elements like creatures or killers

6) to not have a happy ending

 bonus) would be somethingc underwater or about a new civilization

I don’t want to spoil too much about the show, but it essentially follows a group of teenagers who work for a secret paranormal investigation known as “The Center.” 

They travel all over Canada (it’s a French/Canadian anime) and occasionally in parts of Europe to solve mysteries, most of which are *extremely* horrifying. (Even rewatching as an adult I get the willies with the animation/lore of certain creatures).

An iconic (for what *I* think is iconic) is one that’s seems to be loosely based off The Shining. It’s a few episodes in to Season 1, but a great one to pull you in with. **S1 E14: Haunting of the Blackwater**

,televisionsuggestions,"I love shows focused on watching a group survive together. And they end up becoming close because of their experiences. And by that I mean platonic relationships, Family and friends.  I'm good with Romance, as long as it's a **subplot** and never overtakes the plot. Although no romance is even better(doubt there are any though).

I also enjoy thriller, supernatural, action, and stuff that have me on the edge of my seat.

So basically shows featuring strong platonic relationships and doesn't exaggerate romance that have action/supernatural thriller(Doesn't have to be English). For example:

(Bolded ones are the ones that perfectly fit the kind of show I want)

* **Teen Wolf**
   * I loved the friendships and the supernatural elements
   * First season had a lot of annoying teenage romance, but it got way better after(I actually was fine with the couple).
   * I love how they handled supernatural beings and occurances
   * I enjoyed how unpredictable it was, I could never tell what was going to happen.
* **The Walking Dead**
   * Kinda got annoyed with the non-stop killing but I enjoyed the group.
   * The zombies were nice
   * Loved the father-son moments between Rick and Carl
   * The romance here was actually okay.
* Stranger Things
   * Second season was the best, the third season was too daily life and romance. Not much seriousness.
* The 100
   * Some characters were annoying and there was a lot of distrust. But I enjoyed the action and friendships.
* Sherlock Holmes
   * Not a group, but I enjoyed the duo.
   * Loved the mystery(even though I never understood until the ending).
* **The Gifted**
   * Superpowers, family, Good guys vs bad guys. Loved this show.
* izombie
   * I've only watched two seasons, don't know if it has a lot of romance later.
   * I like it, it's funny, got super-powered people, and I enjoy murder-mystery.

What I don't like:

* The Vampire Diaries
   * Too much romance, sex, and unnecessary drama.
* Teenage dramas that centre around romance.
* Riverdale
   * No
* Anything with the main genre being Romance
* A lone wolf MC throughout the entire show.

Oh and I don't like sex scenes.

**I also enjoy horror, so feel free to add those.**

,televisionsuggestions," Hello all,

This is my first time posting in this sub. If this sorta post is disallowed, please feel free to flag or remove it.

Anyway, like I said in the title, I'm looking for tv recommendations with romance. The genre need not necessarily be romance per se (although that's perfectly fine), but the show needs to have romance in it. And the romance needs to have at least moderate significance.

I'm especially looking for shows where a single guy, smart/introverted/not very popular with the ladies (at least initially), finds love. Examples of such shows I've watched and loved include Cobra Kai (Miguel x Samantha), Sex Education (Otis x Maeve), Sherlock (the Irene Adler episode, specifically), Death Note (an exception, because I loved the L character, but he never really finds love in the show, as far as I remember), Suits (although Mike wasn't particularly unpopular with the ladies to begin with, the part I most liked about the show was Mike x Rachel), Smallville (Clark x Lois) and The Big Bang Theory (for Sheldon, although I hate him and Amy).

Looking forward to your recommendations.",t2_9hq3v8rk,False,,0,False,"Looking for show recommendations where a single guy who's smart/introverted/not very popular with the ladies (at least initially), finds love.",[],r/televisionsuggestions,False,6,,0,,,False,t3_kyk2hi,False,dark,1.0,,public,6,1,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,6,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1610836950.0,text,6,,,text,self.televisionsuggestions,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello all,&lt;/p&gt;

,televisionsuggestions,"This sub is great for normal people who aren't constantly searching for new stuff. But for those of us with an obsession searching for the next thing to watch, it can get pretty draining when articles pop up titled ""Awesome shows you've NEVER heard of!"" and it lists The Killing, Counterpart, The Americans, etc etc...

So I'm just looking for anything you love that genuinely doesn't come up all that often. Any language is fine. I'll throw a few out:

**Informer**. Currently on Prime in the US. A 6-episode miniseries that looks and feels like a movie, with some excellent performances and a solid plot. It's an interesting mix of on-the-ground police work in London, but centered on cops trying to work informants against terrorists. It's been compared to The Night Of -- which seems a little racist and maybe just based on the stars sharing a similar look -- but there's a similar sense of dread and a beautifully intense setup. It's not the best mystery in the world -- I feel like most viewers will figure out parts of it before you're ""supposed"" to -- but it's also not a show that's dependent on that kind of surprise. Really well done. 

**Undercover**. On Netflix, two seasons, but each season is very serialized and complete. You know how sometimes people say a foreign crime show is awesome, and then you watch it, and at some point you realize that's it's actually pretty dumb but just looks cool and is not in English so it seems classier? This isn't quite that, but it's also not some genre-bending or brilliant piece of writing -- instead it's just a Belgian series that's a bit of trashy fun. Two cops go undercover to catch a crime boss, befriending him at his weekend getaway house at a campground of sorts. There's *tiny* bit of Justified Season 2 in here in the way that the bad guys are somehow both more and less sophisticated than you think they are, and there's a bit of that kind of humor as well. 

**Des**, starring David Tennant. This one got a bit more play so I'm reaching probably calling it under-talked-about, but perhaps (like me) you thought people were talking about *Devs* when they were throwing this out. It's about a real-life serial killer who is captured, and over three hour-long episodes is interviewed and investigated. It gets compared to Mindhunter, which is pretty fair, although I should qualify that I like and don't love Mindhunter.

However, the bug has bit and I'm wanting some nice urban fantasy. Animation is fine, subtitles are iffy (I love foreign media, but I have to be in the right mood to watch something subbed and I'm for sure not doing a live action dub \*shudders\*). I don't want anything grimdark or otherwise hilariously dark. Elements of horror are ok too, but I don't know if I want to go fully into that space after giving myself a couple Sam Esmail and Mike Flanagan chartered head trips. I can be persuaded to do high fantasy or sci-fi, but it's gotta have solid worldbuilding and some sense of mystery and the unknown. Shows and films I've watched and enjoyed that fall into this category- 

• **The Legend of Korra** \- Specifically, I'm a huge fan of ATLA (Who isn't these days?) and love the way this show evolves the setting and continues its use of mundane magic - that is, magic used for everyday things. I also love how it incorporates its Asian aesthetics into 1920s design trends and I'm a sucker for art deco and other 20s aesthetic styles as well. I didn't like the way this show was structured in a seasonal villain way, but enjoyed that each season's conflict had implications for the next. 

**• Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood** \- I loved this show's hard magic system as well, and the way it slowly escalates. It fooled me into thinking it was villain of the week until it started building a very interesting central plot based around a lot of solid intrigue and conspiracy, and the way it slowly escalated until you had &gt;!a giant Lovecraftian nightmare trying to steal the moon!&lt; and everything about it made perfect sense in context was also really cool. 

• **Early Supernatural** \- the sort of neowestern vibe, muscle cars and haunted Americana was really appealing to me for the first five seasons and I gave this show way too many second chances when it got dumb. 

• **Angel** \- What can I say? I love atonement arcs and film noir.

**The first three Pirates of the Caribbean films** \- Yes, it gets a little ridiculous and over the top, but I love a good pirate yarn and I'm also really into the way these films built a setting where the characters and world take superstition and the logic of superstition so seriously. It's a world where you take random junk out of your pockets and call it a piece of eight because it sounds more piratey that way, and for these guys, sounding piratey has weight. And the setting kind of agrees with them. 

• **Basically anything Guillermo Del Toro has ever done**

• **Star Wars** \- It's fantasy. Change my mind. 

I kind of liked, but couldn't fully get into - 

• **Penny Dreadful** \- I watch my shows over dinner. I'm sorry, but, like, maggots are a dealbreaker. Some cool ideas here and I liked the strong literary bend that it has, but a little too much on the gore and sex for my tastes. 

• **Carnival Row** \- I'm watching this one with someone else, and we appear to have put it on indefinite hold, so we liked it, but apparently not enough to keep going immediately after a couple episodes. 

I've ruled out - 

• **His Dark Materials** \- I've heard this gets super anti-religious, and that's not something I'm into. I want to get told I'm stupid for being religious, I can get that just as easily on this very site.

,televisionsuggestions,"Hi,

I'm searching for a serie for my mom. The problem is that she has very difficult tastes, it's difficult to find a compromise. Here are what I would like :

\- Nearly no violence. She can't see anything that have even a bit of blood (medical context is ok). Sex is ok, it's only the violence that she doesn't like at all. Something a bit stressful is ok, but little to no violence. If I can give you a measure, something like Homecoming which is a bit stressful but without any violence is ok, but something like Killing Eve with cold blood murders is not.

\- Not too long. Something that has 8 seasons of 10 hours each is too long, and that discourage her.

\- Not too slow scenario. Too much filler episodes would bore her. The most interesting series are often thrillers, but feature violence. That's where the compromise is difficult to find.

She absolutely loved The Queen's Gambit. I think that's for 2 reasons : First, she loves that 50-60s era and its style. Also, I think she loved getting attached to a single character, and following her through the whole show. I think something that focuses on some characters rather than a lot would get her much more attached to them and making her want to continue.

I'm always in search of good things to recommend to my family, but I have big difficulties to find things for my mother as 99% of the shows I know are too violent.

Thanks in advance for any suggestion, don't hesitate to ask me for more details on a specific point. Have a great day

,televisionsuggestions,"Hi All,

As the title says, I'm looking for shows that have a great ship you can really root for. Two people who are super compatible and have their ups and downs but have great chemistry. They don't necessarily have to end up together in the end. Although that's a plus, the relationship I was rooting for &gt;!(Lee and Kara :( Loved Adama and Roslin as well of course)!&lt; on my favorite show of all time (Battlestar Galactica) never panned out and I still love it.

**Some couples I've really loved are:**

* Ben and Leslie (and April and Andy) in Parks and Rec
* All the couples or not-quite couples in Firefly
* David and Keith in Six Feet Under
* Jaime and Brienne in Game of Thrones (Another one that didn't work out, but I was living for it in seasons 3-7)
* Eleanor and Chidi in the Good Place
* Jake and Amy in Brooklyn 99
* Patrick and David in Schitt's Creek
* My memory's fuzzy but I enjoyed all the various relationships on Freaks and Geeks
* Spike/Buffy and Willow/Tara
* Mindy/Danny on the Mindy Project (at least for a while...)
* Various couples on Sense8

As you can see I definitely like lighter comedies ala Michael Shur, but I am also a big sci-fi/fantasy fan so I'm definitely interested in those kinds of suggestions. Dramas are fine too. Basically, anything with a romance that sucks you in and makes you root for the couple(s). Bonus points if they get together in the end, but if not, there's always fan fiction.

Excited for any suggestions you may have. Oh yes, and I did just binge Bridgerton so I'm open to period stuff as well.

---

# Devs

Finally got caught up on this Goddard Sci-Fi mediation. I really liked all of the actors involved, even with the protagonist's actor reading her lines like a cardboard automation. It looks good, raises some interesting questions and doesn't overstay its welcome.

# The Haunting of Bly Manor

I really liked the spiritual ""prequel"" a lot more as The Haunting of Hill House really brought the horror with some amazing shots and cast. I had the same expectations for Bly Manor and I was left disappointed. It's still a good enough series, I just had misaligned expectations. Hill House was definitely a horror, Bly is much more a mystery drama that also happens to be about ghosts.

# The Mandalorian (Season 2)

It had less magic than the first season but I still enjoyed my time. I liked the expanding of the lore and seeing a lot of character development for Mando. The ending of the season had me torn; on one hand, my inner child was cheering gleefully but my adult half was rolling his eyes at this degree of pandering. I'll still watch the next season and I'll stand by that The Mandalorian is more Star Wars than the sequel trilogies.

# Star Trek: Lower Decks (Season 1)

I guess someone finally realized that they could capitalize on The Orville's success. This is Star Trek in the post-TNG/DS9 universe but played for laughs with the focus being on who would just be extras in any other normal Star Trek series. There's been too many alternative pasts, mirror universes and far-future scenarios to try to make Star Trek easy to be on-boarded within the last iterations. Lower Decks eschews that for the classic but injects fun comedy into the mix.

I also have occasionally broken the loop, including shows I liked a lot, “Person of interest” “The walking dead” “Breaking bad” “better call saul”

I like story rich shows with in depth characters, also if possible a show that’s not afraid to kill of their characters to keep the viewer on edge.

&lt;p&gt;I have a bad habit of picking shows with good beginnings and terrible endings, please help me break this loop!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These shows of which I speak of included “Dexter” (Yes I do look forward to the final seasons reboot) “The rain” “Zoo” “The 100”. (Liked them but turned terrible)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also have occasionally broken the loop, including shows I liked a lot, “Person of interest” “The walking dead” “Breaking bad” “better call saul”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like story rich shows with in depth characters, also if possible a show that’s not afraid to kill of their characters to keep the viewer on edge. &lt;/p&gt;

,televisionsuggestions," I would love to see some epic-fantastic series.

I've been watching Teen wolf. The first season was OK but the second one is dull. The plot has just got down and reduced its charm, engaging content. It's like the intrigue has slumped to a boring level in which the violence and scenes have turned quiet repetitive.

It's been a while since I don't watch a really epic series. One that really gets me excited to watch. The last series that I actually loved was Merlin from BBC.

,televisionsuggestions,"In a discussion about streaming services, people started talking about *Fargo*, and I realized that it has been a long time since I saw a really good series in that caliber. And I really struggle to find one that I haven’t already seen.

Going by my list below, I guess one could say that I like *dark drama* and *crime*, focused on *realism* and that takes place in the *present or semi-present time*. A hint of sci-fi is acceptable, if it still feels realistic, same thing with action.

I leave out comedy/sitcom/humor and cartoons/anime, since those genres are very different and would be best in a separate post.

Also, a *good script* and *good acting* is essential for me. So many series (and movies) have looked good on paper, but fall short on these things.

It is really hard to put a finger on what I really like, but all the ones in my top list have “it”, and I am looking for other series that will give me a similar feeling.

**Creme de la creme:**

* Breaking bad
* House of cards
* Fargo
* Ozark
* Killing Eve (edit)
* Narcos
* Westworld (first 2 seasons)
* The Fall (edit)
* 30 Degrees in February (Swedish, not really dark, but interesting in a different way)
* Better call Saul
* Dexter
* Mr Robot
* Sopranos
* Gomorrah (Italian)
* Handmaid's Tale

**Runners-up:**

* Six Feet Under
* Oz
* The wire
* Big little lies
* Real Humans (Swedish)
* The Rain (Danish)
* Skam (Norwegian)
* The walking dead (first season, or maybe even just the first episode)
* Black mirror (some episodes were good)

**Seem interesting, might watch:**

* The Deuce
* True detective
* Billions

&amp;#x200B;

Below is a list of series that for some reason hasn’t been right for me. It’s **not** a list of “bad” series, they just don’t match my taste or for some other reason didn’t feel right when I watched it. I put it here as some examples, to get a better sense of what I like and dislike.

**Not really my style:**

* Sweet home (my wife loves it though, and is playing in the background right now lol)
* Game of thrones
* Stranger things
* Vikings
* Boardwalk Empire
* Channel Zero
* West Wing
* Deadwood
* LOST
* Band of Brothers
* Taboo
* Rome
* The 100
* Fringe
* Doctor Who
* Supernatural
* Sherlock
* The shield
* Mad men
* Mindhunter
* Star Trek / Farscape / Babylon 5 / Stargate

,televisionsuggestions,"Hi All,

So lately been watching a lot of *gritty* shows... and I find it takes its toll on my emotional wellbeing / mental health for a while after. (For example, after watching season 1 of The Boys... I found myself getting lost in the drama of the show, and feeling angry at certain characters... even though it's just a show. And for days afterward, I still had this uncomfortable ""emotional residue"" after watching it.)

So, I'm looking for suggestions for shows that are more wholesome, lighthearted, or at least generally end on a good note. (That are still engaging and interesting--it's sometimes tricky to balance wholesomeness with being engaging and keeping my interest.)

Some shows that I've liked that are the sort of thing I'm looking for:

Comedy:

* Parks and Recreation
* The Office
* Community (not my fav, but it's okay)

Sci-Fi:

* The Mandalorian
* Star Trek (TNG, DS9, VOY)
* Babylon 5
* Doctor Who

Anime:

* Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood (great mix of wholesomeness, but also engaging enough to be interesting)

&amp;#x200B;

Some shows that I'm not interested in:

* The Good Place
* 30 Rock (just not my style... too many unrelatable characters)
* Psych
* The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel (too drama-y)
* Veep (too cynical; characters too mean to each other)

And for days afterward, I still had this uncomfortable &amp;quot;emotional residue&amp;quot; after watching it.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I&amp;#39;m looking for suggestions for shows that are more wholesome, lighthearted, or at least generally end on a good note. (That are still engaging and interesting--it&amp;#39;s sometimes tricky to balance wholesomeness with being engaging and keeping my interest.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some shows that I&amp;#39;ve liked that are the sort of thing I&amp;#39;m looking for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comedy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Parks and Recreation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Office&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Community (not my fav, but it&amp;#39;s okay)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sci-Fi:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Star Trek (TNG, DS9, VOY)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Babylon 5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doctor Who&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anime:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood (great mix of wholesomeness, but also engaging enough to be interesting)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some shows that I&amp;#39;m not interested in:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Good Place&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;30 Rock (just not my style... too many unrelatable characters)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Psych&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel (too drama-y)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Veep (too cynical; characters too mean to each other)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ty!&lt;/p&gt;

By evil I don’t necessarily mean a cold blooded murder, I mean a character who is morally grey. 
Maybe they have good intentions for themselves but ignore the lives of others? 
A really good example is Breaking Bad.

Like my favourite shows include: Avatar: the Last Airbender (I re watch this every 2 years, it’s my al time favourite, but that could be the nostalgia talking). Dr. Horrible’s Sing Along Blog (is this technically a movie?), Bojack Horseman, The Midnight Gospel, Buffy the Vampire Slayer (and Angel). RWBY was actually really good until after season 3. Also the Chilling Adventures of Sabrina, Merlin, and The Magicians, but I don’t truly enjoy those as much, they just cure the boredom. 

I despise when a show runs too long and storylines become more and more absurd and villains that were scary earlier become easy kill. 

I like it when origins stories and other things aren’t entirely explained and left for the viewer to imagine or if they’re later expanded in comics after the show has ended. (Like how in a:tla, the story is Zuko’s mom is a mystery, but you can read the comics for a full story. Or that the origins of bending aren’t completely concrete (‘the animals taught us’ and ‘they watched the moon’) kind of like early human understanding/explanation of the world.

Also unnecessary sex and romantic side plots bore the f out of me and ruin a show entirely.

What I liked so much about the show is it felt fresh and new. Television over the last decade has been very dark and gritty, and all the really good shows usually have some form of existential threat or ultra-high stakes. And if they don’t fall into this category, they’re most likely a comedy. The Queen’s Gambit was different in that it wasn’t ultra dark, it wasn’t super gritty, and the biggest outwardly threat was losing a chess tournament (which is fairly trivial). What makes it so captivating is that it’s a much more intimate story. It’s a beautifully done character study that follows a woman from childhood to adulthood as she deals with adult themes like love, drugs, and life purpose. Fact of the matter is, Beth Harmon is just an awesome, yet relatable character.

Ever since starting those two shows, every other show seems much too boring. For example, I tried watching the first episode of Longmire and The Crown and simply found them way too easy.

In House of Cards and Game of Thrones, there are always a lot of moving parts, and every action has a direct and indirect effect on many different characters and events. They also move incredibly fast in their pacing, so much so that every word holds some kind of weight in the show. I genuinely get the same feeling from those shows as I do from reading a good book. Does anyone have any shows to recommend that watches the same as those two shows?

(It also would be nice if the show were to take place in a world disconnected from our own, like Game of Thrones, but that's not a requirement.)

,televisionsuggestions,"I finished The Queen's Gambit and was thoroughly shocked by how much I enjoyed it! Amazing writing, amazing acting, amazing character development - just amazing overall. But now I need something to fill the void as I have that post-binge depression. 

I typically enjoy drama and action (drama more than action), and I typically stay away from comedy unless it's more of a dramedy or has some other redeeming qualities other than the ability to make me laugh. Acting, character development, great plot, and things that will make you think are my cup of tea. I like shows were the characters draw you in and give you amazing character development (why I liked The Queen's Gambit), have a convoluted plot making you have to put pieces together (Dark), has some mystery (also Dark), something that's smart or just generally makes you think. 

So, shows I've liked in the past:

* **The Queen's Gambit** \- It had great acting, great character development and I loved watching Beth go from &gt;!orphan to prodigy while dealing with addiction!&lt;. Something about her character just draws you in. 
* **Dark** \- (I haven't seen the two new seasons, I'm just not in the mood for foreign language right now) - I loved the mystery, mind-blowing twists, and trying to piece everything together. Also liked their take on the whole &gt;!time travel!&lt; premise. 
* **Umbrella Academy** \- Loved the mystery and how fleshed out the characters were. The plot was great.
* **Haunting of Hill House** \- Had a great plot, again, characters drew you in, and the twists, turns and necessity to put pieces together were awesome! Also, episode five whether &gt;!they're stuck inside the funeral home during the thunderstorm!&lt; might be some of the best TV I've ever seen. This one surprised me as I usually can't tolerate horror (I don't get the thrill of being scared...I just get scared). 
* **Stranger Things** \- One of my favorite shows of all time! The characters pull you in and I like those sci-fi elements, as well as the fact that it's a period piece.
* **11/22/63** \- Just an overall great plot and premise, although I do love Stephen King so that's probably why.

There's definitely other shows I've seen and loved as well, just don't want to make this too long. I've also liked shows like Ozark and The Boys in the past, and I have to finish those series, I'm just not in the mood for a superhero genre or traditional high crime show at the moment. I want something a little smarter.

I'm Thinking of Ending Things is on my radar and totally seems like my cup of tea, but it looks like there are some freaky horror elements to it and I'd have to kind of mentally prepare myself for that (it's the only way I got through Haunting of Hill House).

,televisionsuggestions,"I just wanted to let everyone know, you should watch The Queen’s Gambit on Netflix. 

I had planned on writing this long review, but felt I couldn’t do it without giving away too many spoilers, so I’ll give a brief synopsis. 

The base plot of the show is about an orphaned girl in the 1960’s who is a prodigal chess player trying to prove herself in a sport dominated by men. We’ve seen this before, and to be honest, had someone described the show to me in that way I would have told them “I’ll pass”. But it’s so much more than that. The show does dive into some feminist elements, but it doesn’t hit you over the head with it, which I appreciated (I usually don’t like when shows get too preachy about there agendas - I’m looking at you, Watchmen). Instead of positioning the show as “it’s about a girl who’s breaking the glass ceiling of chess”, it’s more along the lines of “Beth is just a bad-ass chess player who happens to be a woman”. 

Where the show really shines, and what makes it so great, is it’s character development. It’s an analysis of how the main character, Beth Harmon (played by Anya Taylor-Joy), deals with life from being an orphan, to becoming an awkward school girl, to finding her passion and becoming a prodigy - all the while dealing with unchecked drug addiction. Also, and I don’t know how they do it, but somehow they’ve found a way to make chess exciting. I don’t know chess, I’ve never played chess, and it seems like the most boring game of all time...but I’d be lying if I didn’t want to learn how to play by the end of it. Finally, I really can’t say enough about how phenomenal an actress Anya Taylor-Joy is. I finished the show and then watched her interviews and was absolutely stunned it was the same person. 

I know there’s no way in hell I’m doing this show justice, but please take my word for it. If you like character pieces, go to Netflix and watch the little minute-long preview they give you, and then go ahead and watch the first scene.

,televisionsuggestions,"Hi I like to watch TV series with my family every day and recently it seems that we've run out of Boston Legal episodes, so here I am!

I'd like something that doesn't cover anything too heavy and is lighthearted or/and a comedy

We enjoyed watching [Monk](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0312172/), [Boston Legal](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0402711/), [Once Upon a Time](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1843230/) *(Though now when* ***I*** *look back at that one; it wasn't that great),* [Life](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0874936/) and [Rapl](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5976538/)

Most of those shows have something to do with detective *type* ... things  \*\*\*(oh boy im gud at languag)\*\*\*but I don't think that has to be a requirement

*A big requirement is that the show isn't* ***only*** *available in english, though this is difficult and too much to ask for since you would be the one that would go out of their way to research that...*

What we don't want:

Though **I** personally enjoy this kind of stuff;  anything to do with action secret agents is not enjoyable for all of us, the Kingsman for example is a nono. Another thing is stuff like LOTR or Harry Potter, just nothing that has too much of it's own lore.. I guess

We'll be wathing it as a family, what Boston Legal had was perfectly fine, but anything that is too too explicit is just a no

Also please no triggers such as suicide and rape (again Boston Legal had a bit, but it was an acceptable amount)

One last thing: no animation (unfortunately)

,televisionsuggestions,"So I'm trying to curb my GW2 addiction by watching tv shows instead.

I just binged all 3 seasons of Roswell and 2 seasons of the reboot Roswell, New Mexico.

I didn't expect to be completely sucked in especially since Roswell is more aimed at teenagers but I absolutely love the whole cliche ""there's more to this world than I thought"" kinda thing (in this case aliens, but it doesn't have to be aliens, could be magic or superpowers etc)

In the original Roswell I loved that they were constantly scared of being exposed and had to figure out who they could trust and who they shouldn't trust, I despised the ridiculous love triangle when Tess was introduced and I'll admit I found the backstory for the aliens (them being royal etc) kinda ridiculous. I disliked that it ended on an open ending. Overall I thought that the first season was the strongest.

In the reboot I'm **living** for the romance and the characters are very likeable to me, I find myself not caring too much about the story itself though.

&amp;#x200B;

In general I absolutely **Love**: Sci fi Fantasy Supernatural themes I'm also a sucker for romance, I don't like love triangles and usually suffer from Second Lead Syndrome

At the moment I'm looking for shows with a theme where either the main character finds out there's more to this world than they thought or that they have some sort of special power, and preferably not scary/horror, I could never really get into Supernatural because I find it too scary XD

I don't mind if its cheesy like Charmed and I don't mind if its an older show (80s+) it doesn't have to be in English as long as its relatively easy to find English subtitles.

I could also do with recommendations for other sci fi and fantasy shows that don't necessarily follow that theme.

Penny Dreadful (original) 9.75/ 10 story, atmosphere, actors, scary factor.  A few points lost for a rushed/ not as good final season.  

The Alienist: 7/10 decent story based on true stories, and great atmosphere 

The Exorcist 9/10. Scary!!! Geena Davis and Alan Ruck and a hot Hispanic priest? Hello! I’ve only seen season one so far and love it, seems underrated, no one talks about it ! 

Evil. 7.25/10 not bad for network tv.  Prodigal Son is better of new shows form last year 

Prodigal Son 9.5/10. Superb season one 

Salem. 8/10 Best witch show out there.  Underrated 

The Purge 7/10. Starts good, a bit cheesy sometimes 

Helstrom 8/10. I’m only a few eps in; seems great will see’ 

Monsterland. 0. Not good, didn’t finish Ep 1 

V wars. 6/10 Cheesy vamp show, had promise, didn’t finish maybe gets better? 

Daybreak 7.5/10   Entertaining! 

American Horror Story season 1: 7.5/10 the rest are trash

The Terror: season one 9/10 

Castle Rock 8.5/10. I liked it a lot! Interesting keeps you guessing lots of Stephen King Easter eggs. Read the sub for it, it’s confusing sometimes 

Haunting of Hill House: 8.5/10 great
Bly Manor: 7/10 okay 

The Mist:  7/10 I liked it but it’s cheaply done sorta 

Hemlock Grove: 7/10 starts awesome!! A lot of potential! Gets way too weird and loses the cool factor. 

The Order: watched half of it, it was so-so. Teen show.  6/10

What We Do in the Shadows: just started great so far, funny and unique 

Santa Clarita Diet: 9/10 loved this! Hilarious! Mad it’s cancelled 

Mindhunter: based on true story, 9.75/10 
Great show

&lt;p&gt;The Terror: season one 9/10 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Castle Rock 8.5/10. I liked it a lot! Interesting keeps you guessing lots of Stephen King Easter eggs. Read the sub for it, it’s confusing sometimes &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Haunting of Hill House: 8.5/10 great
Bly Manor: 7/10 okay &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Mist:  7/10 I liked it but it’s cheaply done sorta &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hemlock Grove: 7/10 starts awesome!! A lot of potential! Gets way too weird and loses the cool factor. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Order: watched half of it, it was so-so. Teen show.  6/10&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What We Do in the Shadows: just started great so far, funny and unique &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Santa Clarita Diet: 9/10 loved this! Hilarious! Mad it’s cancelled &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mindhunter: based on true story, 9.75/10 
Great show &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Others that look good I’ve not seen, people can rate what they think: Lore, NOS4A2, Kingdom (zombie one), Dracula, Creepshow, Bates Motel, Ash vs the Evil Dead, Lovecraft County, Channel Zero&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In dramas, I like complex characters, maybe a bit of mystery, and psychological stuff is pretty interesting as well. I also like sci-fi, so anything in that category I could try out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I liked the humor in New Girl a lot and also in Parks and Rec, but I hate the office. So please don&amp;#39;t suggest that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: I forgot I also watched The Marvelous Mrs Maisel and really liked it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

,televisionsuggestions,"Hello everyone. I need your help finding a show. You see, everyone in my family likes very different things when it comes to TV, but we still want a show we all like. I’ve narrowed down our preferences to a few key factors and I need your help finding a show keeping those factors in mind. I need to separate the shows into both comedies and others because I have a very specific set of rules for comedies that doesn’t apply to other shows that aren’t specifically comedies.

&amp;#x200B;

Comedy:

Innovative- we like things that are different from the copy and paste comedies you see on TV. For example, in the past we’ve liked Schitt’s Creek and Curb Your Enthusiasm.

No Hugging, No Learning- This is a term coined by Larry David which basically states that the show’s goal should only be comedy. I don’t want to watch a show that is trying to teach me something nor do I want to show that tries to tie in drama between the jokes. We’re only interested in pure comedy.

No love stories- I'm not interested in a show that's based purely around relationships or even mostly based around relationships. It's fine if the characters are in a relationship, but that should never be the main focus.

No Saints- The characters don’t have to be horrible, but I find genuinely good people in comedies to be boring. I’ll take George Costanza, Dennis Reynolds, and Larry David over Ted Mosby and Leslie Knope any day.

&amp;#x200B;

Others:

I genuinely don’t know if a show like this exists or can exist, but we want a non-comedy show to be not too deep/dark, but also have large stakes. What I mean by large stakes is we want to watch something greater than ourselves. For example, if in a tv show the conflict doesn’t affect anyone else other than the main characters, we’re just not too interested.

Realistic- Needs to be something that could conceivably happen in real life (no sci-fi or fantasy concepts).

No Violence

&amp;#x200B;

Disqualifiers:

No reality TV

No “competition” shows

No documentaries

No animated TV

&amp;#x200B;

If it helps, here’s a list of shows we both like and shows either one or both of us didn’t like.

&amp;#x200B;

Liked:

Curb Your Enthusiasm

Schitt’s Creek

The first two seasons of Brockmire

Seinfeld

Life in Pieces

&amp;#x200B;

Disliked:

It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia

&lt;p&gt;Altered carbon, the sci-fi, dystopia, the phylosophy, the visuals, &lt;/p&gt;

Note: by ""private detectives"" I mean professional detectives or investigators that are employed by individuals or organizations, *not* police detectives or other law enforcement (e.g. FBI or medical examiners) and *not* amateur sleuths whose day job is baker or mystery author or country vicar or something cozy like that. 

Many of the obvious ones I've already watched: *Sherlock*, *Elementary*, *Poirot*, *Veronica Mars*, HBO's *Perry Mason*, *Magnum P.I.* (original and reboot), *Jessica Jones*, *Monk,* *Stumptown,* etc.

,televisionsuggestions,"Hi guys,

I usually don't have time to binge but I'm between jobs and I just finished watching attack on titan and was amazed at how well written the overall plot, character , story, world etc. was. I'm actually thinking of watching something similar to that but am having a hard time finding something or don't wanna get invested in something only to get my heart broken by a badly written ending ala Game of Thrones, ala Star Wars or ala Lost style. 

I wanted to ask if any of you have recommendations for any shows (or any form of media, video games, novels etc.) with a combination good world building, character building and narratives and stay strong throughout the whole franchise or at least most of it. 

I would say shows, video games that I have consumed that fall into these categories include: Avatar the Last Airbender, FMA Brotherhood, Dragon Age Origins, Game of Thrones Novels, Attack on Titan (so far the manga has been strong)

Long running shows/novels/franchises which I've liked but wouldn't say were strong the whole way so you have an idea of my taste: Game of Thrones, Supernatural, Percy Jackson, Naruto, Vampire Diaries

I started to realize I'm an ultimate character stan and am the type to sit out through something as long as there's one character I really like so I'd probably sit out the whole show unless they end up dying or having their personality completely slaughtered by an asspull by the writers (which happens very regularly towards the later parts of tv shows unfortunately).

,televisionsuggestions,"So I'm looking for more mature teen/young adult/family drama shows basically with female protagonists.

I feel like female athletics are underrepresented in TV shows, sadly :( The only one I can remember actually focusing on female athletes working together was Make It or Break It (which, while a bit catty and not that accurate gymnastically, had a lot of heart without being overly graphic/dramatic in my opinion). This is probably the best example of what kind of show I'm looking for and I was pretty devastated when it got cancelled.

I'm not really looking for shows where one woman joins a man's team (a la She's the Man or Kira from Teen Wolf).

In essence, I love the idea of very dramatic shows that do not rely solely on infidelity or crime to propel them forward...hence sports where the drama comes from training and competition, and is a lot more wholesome and inspiring (to me). I love the idea of team, working together, friendship, and coming-of-age while making huge life decisions at a young age, with the parents/adults/coaches also playing a big role in the athletes succeeding and the plot. Romance is always a bonus, especially shows that depict romance between teens as well as adults (a la Gilmore Girls, where the romance was evenly focused on teens like Rory and adults like Lorelai).

Preferably PG or PG-13 style (aka not super graphic). I would love a show with female athletes but I'll take other similar suggestions with the same morals/themes!

I personally love serious tv shows more than lighthearted ones not bc of tone, but because the former usually contains a far better and thought out story. However, I’m not a fan of shows that go beyond the realm of seriousness into darkness. 

Thus, I picked these 2 movies to demonstrate that tone, as they both deal with concepts that are serious and at times dark - but don’t contain things that are too heavy and weight on you.

---

- **The Boys (Season 2):** Still going strong with the anti-establishment jaded look at superheroes. By diverging from the comics, I'm almost more excited because I get to see something new instead of retreading from Ennis' work. I'm a little annoyed at who gets killed off in the beginning but otherwise, every other introduced character has made this season more fun.
- **Lovecraft Country:** Just as the motives of Old Ones are unknowable, Lovecraft Country shows the inscrutable, uncaring nature of white institutions against black folks during the 50s/60s. In addition to the romping pulp nature of comics from that time, you've got a modern update that makes this more than just another attempt at cosmic horror.
- **Raised by Wolves:** It's fine, if there was more Travis Fimmel I might be more interested. He carried my attention in Vikings and I was hoping for a retreat, so far Raised by Wolves doesn't really use him. It's fine speculative far future sci-fi but the reliance on child actors, who mostly aren't terrible, really kills my enjoyment of the series.
- **Star Trek: Lower Decks:** Someone was paying attention when the buzz for Orville was ""It's the best Star Trek currently on air."" Lower Decks is an animated comedy that pokes fun at the stuffy nature of Starfleet. We're set with the crew that never gets any attention as they do their hijinks to slack on work or nerd out on immaterial things. Somehow, this feels like a better Star Trek than Discovery and I laugh each episode.

,televisionsuggestions,"So a while back I did a thread which yielded some great results but I went through most of them and now I’m back

I’ll post a link to that thread so you can see more details of what we’ve watched and what’s been suggested to us.

But here’s a quick recap and update: my mom is in her mid-60’s and can’t stand serious vulgarity or sex scene. 
So shows like deadwood are non-starters.

It doesn’t have to be PG but maybe PG-13. The occasional F word won’t kill her but it just can’t be every other sentence 

And sex stuff has to be at an absolute minimum. Kissing is fine but no thrusting or heads going down for oral, and obviously nothing actually graphic (it’s a damn shame because the Boys actually peaked her interest)

Anyway: what we love the most is modern crime shows.

Bosch 

Chicago PD (just finished the last free season on amazon and need to find a place to stream 6 and 7)

Southland 

Flashpoint

The Mentalist (though we’ve seen just about every iteration of the talented consultant like
Monk, Psych, Sherlock, but maybe there’s some we’ve missed. She won’t watch Lucifer

Longmire

Justified

Criminal Minds (until it started trying to outdo itself with darker and more twisted guys and became hard to watch)

Sneaky Pete 

Hanna 

Homecoming

Fargo

The show about the lawyer who’s also a prisoner but the name escapes me

Prodigal son

Bodyguard

Broadchurch

Interrogation

Midsommar mysteries (or whatever it was called)

Ncis (though I don’t think we’ve watched all the spin offs yet)

People vs OJ was great (but we couldn’t watch the  Versace follow up because of the sexual nature of it)

The Shield had to be turned off because of language and mind hunter had to be turned off of because of sexual language/vulgarity just to give you an idea of what I’m working with.

Something like Goliath I’m told would have too much language.

Mom doesn’t like sci-fi or fantasy at all. The farthest we ever got was watching 2 seasons of the good place but she would never consider black mirror or the 100

Umm....but not everything has to be crime related: she also loves Queer Eye and Making the Cut 

Also loves some baking shows (but I can’t stand them so we have to find something we can watch together)

We’re not really interested in older stuff like matlock or Columbo. We want stuff made at least in 2000 or newer. 90’s at the latest unless it’s just amazing.

Blacklist and 

Person of interest were also both big hits. 

And we watched some great Canadian lawyer show which name escapes me.

Tried Veronica Mars but she couldn’t get into it.

Tried Bones but even by her standards it was way too cheesy and lame 

So now you have an idea of what I’m up against haha! She’s hard to choose for! She wants modern high quality but will only sacrifice so much tolerance of vulgarity to get it.

Leverage

Elementary are both on the short list to watch (sadly I’ve already seen leverage but I don’t mind rewatching)

Numbers (I’m aware of but afraid it will be like Bones)

Burn notice has been seen

Suits 

House of cards has been seen (and pushed the upper limit of what mom could tolerate)

,televisionsuggestions,"&amp;#x200B;

What I am talking about wanting to see here is shows like:

The best:

Upload - such a fun ride, SOME crap jokes, but overall so highly entertaining and what a joy to watch

Stargirl - so much fun, for the most part, and such joy to watch the lead actress, she's so cute and likeable, what a joy! The show gives me HOPE somehow. It's so colourful too!

&amp;#x200B;

Almost the best - But kinda lacks a bit of the the Super-FUN and JOY I am looking for:

Home before dark - Maybe not super fun to watch, but fast paced, even, and exciting as hell!

Condor - HIGHLY exciting, fast paced, even, nail biting, but not that fun perhaps.

Ratched - Really fun to watch even though it's supposed to be depressive, dark humour in it somehow, really good show man :) And it manages to be all that with a lead actress that is not that attractive.

&amp;#x200B;

Shows I find addictive but hate at the same time:

Ozark - I have no fun or joy watching this what so ever, even though it is very addictive in many other senses - it makes me so depressed and the main character isn't exactly very charismatic and fun to follow either. And I cannot STAND the LACK of COLOUR in the ""film"" on this one! 

&amp;#x200B;

Shows I absolutely HATE:

Breaking Bad - Super slow, terribly boring, not fun what so ever, miserable show with no fun main plot idea what so ever - who gives a crap about a damn drug manufacturer

Teenage Bounty hunters - cringey shit, not exciting, stupid comedy bullshit - that COULD have been SO great!

Sharp Objects - Slow burner BS - I want NONE of that slowness =/ I am OLD now, and do NOT have the great attention span I had as a kid

I also HATE Almost all MODERN so-called comedy sitcom shit shows, like Brooklyn Nine Nine etc.

&amp;#x200B;

What I am looking for is NOT mindless fun, I like cerebral stuff that makes you THINK, and go WOW, like some eps of star trek the next generation, The Outer Limits, The modern versions of The Twilight Zone, but I am looking for a show that is more FUN than that.

I really like high school girl movies/shows ;) Where the lead actress is in high school - but the kind that are original and great. If you know some good ones that are FUN to watch, please let me know. But please, not mindless bs where evereyone is an idiot. There are tons of shows like that.

&amp;#x200B;

Making your head explode? :) To summarize, I am looking for:

Cute girls, or cool charismatic guys who are FUN to watch in themselves - a show that makes me hopeful like during the 80s, feel joy, where the picture quality is intense in colours (important), which is exciting, mostly even trough out, as in; you rarely are ever bored, the pacing is fast (but not adhd please), 

&amp;#x200B;

Also note:  I have already SEEN most BIG shows, like: Stranger things, A game of thrones, etc :) So no need to recommend the really BIG hit shows. And I wasn't really THAT blown away but stranger things to be honest, it was good, but not mind blowing in any way, kinda recycled the 80s, in a more modern way.

Really hoping to hear from you people, and don't be shy to post stuff, even though I might have seen it or doesn't a 100% fit my description :)

&lt;p&gt;What I am looking for is NOT mindless fun, I like cerebral stuff that makes you THINK, and go WOW, like some eps of star trek the next generation, The Outer Limits, The modern versions of The Twilight Zone, but I am looking for a show that is more FUN than that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really like high school girl movies/shows ;) Where the lead actress is in high school - but the kind that are original and great. If you know some good ones that are FUN to watch, please let me know. But please, not mindless bs where evereyone is an idiot. There are tons of shows like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making your head explode? :) To summarize, I am looking for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cute girls, or cool charismatic guys who are FUN to watch in themselves - a show that makes me hopeful like during the 80s, feel joy, where the picture quality is intense in colours (important), which is exciting, mostly even trough out, as in; you rarely are ever bored, the pacing is fast (but not adhd please), &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also note:  I have already SEEN most BIG shows, like: Stranger things, A game of thrones, etc :) So no need to recommend the really BIG hit shows. And I wasn&amp;#39;t really THAT blown away but stranger things to be honest, it was good, but not mind blowing in any way, kinda recycled the 80s, in a more modern way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Really hoping to hear from you people, and don&amp;#39;t be shy to post stuff, even though I might have seen it or doesn&amp;#39;t a 100% fit my description :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Super summarizing: One word: UPLIFTING, like the movie LIMITLESS, Back the the future, etc :)&lt;/p&gt;

Hey, I want to eventually one day find out what's top 2 or 3 most worthwhile romcoms. Here's progress so far:

**First is the goal:** The goal is to find what is the highest rated romcom according to user ratings

This is for romcom across all types of media (youtube, film, tv, theatre, everything else)

&amp;#x200B;

There's a few things I'm interested in finding out:

* What's best romcom of all time (this seems close to figured out based on the link below)
* What's most worthwhile romcom of last 20 years?
* What's most worthwhile romcom of last 10 years?

&amp;#x200B;

**step 1 -** i googled 'best romcoms' just to see if anything helpful would come up

* \* this was the most helpful, but i dont know if all of these are actually romcoms or just romance
* \* [https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/guide/best-romantic-comedies-of-all-time/](https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/guide/best-romantic-comedies-of-all-time/)

&amp;#x200B;

**step 2** \- from a question i asked previously in one of the sites on reddit (dont rememmber which), i looked at the 4 top 'best' voted comments/suggestions

&amp;#x200B;

**step 3** \- I sorted those 3 by user ratings

\#1

&amp;#x200B;

What's a high rating for film?

* Highly rated = 86 aggregated across all main rating sites (users + critics scores)
   * Examples (looking at my film google sheet): inside out, spirited away, boyhood
* Meh = &lt; 81
   * Examples: dunno i don't add those

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**These are movies, but tv is harder** cos there's not really any user ratings sites for tv. For tv i'd use:

* \* [http://www.showskimmer.com/?t=Married+At+First+Sight+%282014-%29&amp;n=25](http://www.showskimmer.com/?t=Married+At+First+Sight+%282014-%29&amp;n=25)
* \* [https://www.ratingraph.com/tv-shows/married-at-first-sight-ratings-53069/](https://www.ratingraph.com/tv-shows/married-at-first-sight-ratings-53069/)
* \* [https://tvchart.benmiz.com/silicon%20valley](https://tvchart.benmiz.com/silicon%20valley)

but that's only AFTER there are suggestions. I've no idea where these sites get their data from. Prob one of the tv ratings sites I guess

For tv it's a hard search cos I think all of them are lowly rated or something, but am still wondering what's the highest rated one?

&amp;#x200B;

**For tv, msot ppl (like 3..) had recommended ""Love on Spectrum"",** and this is what a users on r/AutisticPride and r/AutisticAdults had to say:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Love on Spectrum *isn't a romcom, it's a documentary series*. Mind you it's a good series, but it's not a romantic comedy (and if people are saying that it is because they were laughing at autistic people in series, then that's a problem).

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I am not a fan of parent interviews as shown in Love on Spectrum, because if we are adults who don't need guardians any more, I don't think our parents' perspectives are as important as our own, and don't really merit inclusion.  
&gt;  
&gt;I can understand including perspective of guardians and caregivers if this series was about people with intellectual disabilities, because oftentimes people with intellectual disabilities do have higher support needs than autistic people do, and of course there are people with both disabilities too.  
&gt;  
&gt;If I were being interviewed for a series like Love on Spectrum, I would say that I'm an adult with a college degree and not to air interviews with my parents if they are interviewed at all. My perspective matters more than theirs in this case.

&amp;#x200B;

Film comment

&gt;Of all RomComs to have ever RomCom'd, ""When Harry Met Sally"" is probably ACME, final form of genre at its height. leads are charming and attractive but not unrealistically so. writing is excellent, performances top notch. It has to be observed carefully, though, because it will suffer a bit from Seinfeld syndrome. It is SO well known, SO much part of culture, that aspects of it look cliche' and overdone, but they're cliche and overdone because THIS FILM POPULARIZED THEM. ""I'll have what she's having"" line is so known and parodied and referenced that it's become its own 'thing' now, but let me tell you, when this was new in theater? That line fucking brought house down. It's hard to think of a better modern example of RomCom.  
&gt;  
&gt;But there's an OLDER one. Possibly one of ORIGINAL Romantic Comedies: Much Ado About Nothing by some unknown English dude named Shakespeare. It's blueprint for every modern romcom. Attractive, but VERY clever people dislike one another. They get involved in a zany plot to help two friends hook up. A villain tries to break things up because he's an ass. Misunderstandings and hilarity ensue. attractive clever people realize their hostility toward each other was masking a deep attraction. Revelations ensue. Ever afters become happy. end. There are others as well: Twelfth Night, Midsummer Night's Dream, Taming of Shrew all contain basic structure and a lot of elements of modern Rom Com.  
&gt;  
&gt;Jump forward a bit and you have Jane Austen: Emma Thompson's 'Sense and Sensibility', any number of versions of 'Pride and Predjudice', 'Emma' (including modern adaptations like 'Clueless!) are all worthy to various degrees.  
&gt;  
&gt;Even more modern, early Judd Apatow comedies like 40 Year Old Virgin and Knocked Up are absolutely romantic comedies, just skewed more towards 'dude' direction than usual.

&amp;#x200B;

**I luv this film bot:** [https://www.reddit.com/user/cinephile\_bot/](https://www.reddit.com/user/cinephile_bot/)

* cos what it does is it takes the comments ppl put
* And then it makes/shows a chart with the ratings

Problem is these aren't user ratings, they're critic ratings

&amp;#x200B;

**Last is the goal:** The goal is to find what is the highest rated romcom according to user ratings

This is for romcom across all types of media (youtube, film, tv, theatre, everything else)

There's a few things I'm interested in finding out:

&lt;p&gt;Hey, I want to eventually one day find out what&amp;#39;s top 2 or 3 most worthwhile romcoms. Here&amp;#39;s progress so far:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First is the goal:&lt;/strong&gt; The goal is to find what is the highest rated romcom according to user ratings&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is for romcom across all types of media (youtube, film, tv, theatre, everything else)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a few things I&amp;#39;m interested in finding out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What&amp;#39;s best romcom of all time (this seems close to figured out based on the link below)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What&amp;#39;s most worthwhile romcom of last 20 years?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What&amp;#39;s most worthwhile romcom of last 10 years?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;step 1 -&lt;/strong&gt; i googled &amp;#39;best romcoms&amp;#39; just to see if anything helpful would come up&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;* this was the most helpful, but i dont know if all of these are actually romcoms or just romance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;* &lt;a href=""https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/guide/best-romantic-comedies-of-all-time/""&gt;https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/guide/best-romantic-comedies-of-all-time/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;step 2&lt;/strong&gt; - from a question i asked previously in one of the sites on reddit (dont rememmber which), i looked at the 4 top &amp;#39;best&amp;#39; voted comments/suggestions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;step 3&lt;/strong&gt; - I sorted those 3 by user ratings&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;8.1 90 &lt;a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0025316/""&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0025316/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;9.6 27 &lt;a href=""https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/city_lights""&gt;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/city_lights&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;7.3 5 &lt;a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3709344/""&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3709344/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;9.0 .1 &lt;a href=""https://www.metacritic.com/movie/city-lights""&gt;https://www.metacritic.com/movie/city-lights&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#3&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;8.1 27 &lt;a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0033045/""&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0033045/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;9.1 12 &lt;a href=""https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/shop_around_the_corner""&gt;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/shop_around_the_corner&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#4&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;7.8 300 &lt;a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2194499/""&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2194499/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;8.1 60 &lt;a href=""https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/about_time""&gt;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/about_time&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;8.6 .5 &lt;a href=""https://www.metacritic.com/movie/about-time""&gt;https://www.metacritic.com/movie/about-time&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(not really for movies) 6.3 1 &lt;a href=""https://rateyourmusic.com/film/about_time/""&gt;https://rateyourmusic.com/film/about_time/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#5&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;7.4 50 &lt;a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9484998/""&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9484998/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;8.8 1.5 &lt;a href=""https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/palm_springs_2020""&gt;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/palm_springs_2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;7.9 .2 &lt;a href=""https://www.metacritic.com/movie/palm-springs""&gt;https://www.metacritic.com/movie/palm-springs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#6&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;8.1 3 &lt;a href=""https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/topper""&gt;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/topper&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;7.3 7 &lt;a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0029682/""&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0029682/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s a high rating for film?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Highly rated = 86 aggregated across all main rating sites (users + critics scores)

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Examples (looking at my film google sheet): inside out, spirited away, boyhood&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meh = &amp;lt; 81

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Examples: dunno i don&amp;#39;t add those&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These are movies, but tv is harder&lt;/strong&gt; cos there&amp;#39;s not really any user ratings sites for tv. For tv i&amp;#39;d use:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;* &lt;a href=""http://www.showskimmer.com/?t=Married+At+First+Sight+%282014-%29&amp;amp;n=25""&gt;http://www.showskimmer.com/?t=Married+At+First+Sight+%282014-%29&amp;amp;n=25&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;* &lt;a href=""https://www.ratingraph.com/tv-shows/married-at-first-sight-ratings-53069/""&gt;https://www.ratingraph.com/tv-shows/married-at-first-sight-ratings-53069/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;* &lt;a href=""https://tvchart.benmiz.com/silicon%20valley""&gt;https://tvchart.benmiz.com/silicon%20valley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but that&amp;#39;s only AFTER there are suggestions. I&amp;#39;ve no idea where these sites get their data from. Prob one of the tv ratings sites I guess&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For tv it&amp;#39;s a hard search cos I think all of them are lowly rated or something, but am still wondering what&amp;#39;s the highest rated one?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For tv, msot ppl (like 3..) had recommended &amp;quot;Love on Spectrum&amp;quot;,&lt;/strong&gt; and this is what a users on &lt;a href=""/r/AutisticPride""&gt;r/AutisticPride&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=""/r/AutisticAdults""&gt;r/AutisticAdults&lt;/a&gt; had to say:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love on Spectrum &lt;em&gt;isn&amp;#39;t a romcom, it&amp;#39;s a documentary series&lt;/em&gt;. Mind you it&amp;#39;s a good series, but it&amp;#39;s not a romantic comedy (and if people are saying that it is because they were laughing at autistic people in series, then that&amp;#39;s a problem).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not a fan of parent interviews as shown in Love on Spectrum, because if we are adults who don&amp;#39;t need guardians any more, I don&amp;#39;t think our parents&amp;#39; perspectives are as important as our own, and don&amp;#39;t really merit inclusion.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can understand including perspective of guardians and caregivers if this series was about people with intellectual disabilities, because oftentimes people with intellectual disabilities do have higher support needs than autistic people do, and of course there are people with both disabilities too.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I were being interviewed for a series like Love on Spectrum, I would say that I&amp;#39;m an adult with a college degree and not to air interviews with my parents if they are interviewed at all. My perspective matters more than theirs in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Film comment&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of all RomComs to have ever RomCom&amp;#39;d, &amp;quot;When Harry Met Sally&amp;quot; is probably ACME, final form of genre at its height. leads are charming and attractive but not unrealistically so. writing is excellent, performances top notch. It has to be observed carefully, though, because it will suffer a bit from Seinfeld syndrome. It is SO well known, SO much part of culture, that aspects of it look cliche&amp;#39; and overdone, but they&amp;#39;re cliche and overdone because THIS FILM POPULARIZED THEM. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ll have what she&amp;#39;s having&amp;quot; line is so known and parodied and referenced that it&amp;#39;s become its own &amp;#39;thing&amp;#39; now, but let me tell you, when this was new in theater? That line fucking brought house down. It&amp;#39;s hard to think of a better modern example of RomCom.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there&amp;#39;s an OLDER one. Possibly one of ORIGINAL Romantic Comedies: Much Ado About Nothing by some unknown English dude named Shakespeare. It&amp;#39;s blueprint for every modern romcom. Attractive, but VERY clever people dislike one another. They get involved in a zany plot to help two friends hook up. A villain tries to break things up because he&amp;#39;s an ass. Misunderstandings and hilarity ensue. attractive clever people realize their hostility toward each other was masking a deep attraction. Revelations ensue. Ever afters become happy. end. There are others as well: Twelfth Night, Midsummer Night&amp;#39;s Dream, Taming of Shrew all contain basic structure and a lot of elements of modern Rom Com.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jump forward a bit and you have Jane Austen: Emma Thompson&amp;#39;s &amp;#39;Sense and Sensibility&amp;#39;, any number of versions of &amp;#39;Pride and Predjudice&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Emma&amp;#39; (including modern adaptations like &amp;#39;Clueless!) are all worthy to various degrees.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even more modern, early Judd Apatow comedies like 40 Year Old Virgin and Knocked Up are absolutely romantic comedies, just skewed more towards &amp;#39;dude&amp;#39; direction than usual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I luv this film bot:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/user/cinephile_bot/""&gt;https://www.reddit.com/user/cinephile_bot/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cos what it does is it takes the comments ppl put&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And then it makes/shows a chart with the ratings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Problem is these aren&amp;#39;t user ratings, they&amp;#39;re critic ratings&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Last is the goal:&lt;/strong&gt; The goal is to find what is the highest rated romcom according to user ratings&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is for romcom across all types of media (youtube, film, tv, theatre, everything else)&lt;/p&gt;

I thought the first three seasons were the best, the 4th season feels kinda deja vu, but I personally loved the five season, even when it was ridiculously dumb. Season 6.. I honestly feel it’s a trash.

,televisionsuggestions," In this post I will be listing my top 5 favorite cartoons and the reasons I love them so much. Hopefully this will help you guys give me some suggestions for new shows. Here’s the shows that I know will be recommended but I already watched them and they didn’t make the list for me:

Steven Universe,Phineas and Ferb, The Legend of Korra, Gravity Falls, Despicable Me 1-3. And for what I’m planning to watch when the next weekend follows is Howls Moving Castle. Alright let’s begin. Also side note I’m a pretty casual viewer like I never look for Easter eggs and stuff.

5.

Spongbob seasons 1-3:

Now I will admit tons of my love for this show comes from nostalgia and if you asked me 5 years ago to make this list spongebob would be number one. Nonetheless I thoroughly enjoyed this shows seasons all through my life as it always seemed care-free everything was goofy stupid nonsensical yet in the weirdest ways it made sense. The show never really had any gut wrenching moments but there was never a dull moment when I needed a laugh or randomly want something to watch I watch spongebob because In my opinion it’s one of the few cartoons where every episode has a different story.

4. 

The Dragon Prince:

This show always felt to me like a show that I had to watch in bursts. And that's ok. The dragon prince definitely felt like the LoTR if I changed it. It just felt so whimsical it dealt with themes carefully but well. Everything also felt like it made sense. Kind of like at first I’d be like 

“This makes no sense no one would do that!”

Then as I thought of it I realized that it did make sense. All in all I like it.

3.

Spirited Away:

Now I usually don’t watch animated movies much less like them but oh my fucking god. This movie grew on me so much. The world it creates is so incredible. You miss it the instant it ends. The final scene with Chihiro looking at the tunnel felt so bittersweet. I adore this movie. Might I add it’s the most rewatched movie I’ve ever seen. It’s just so perfect. The movie and how well thought out everything was.

2.

Avatar: The Last Airbender

(I swear to god if you recommend the live action film I will kill you)

Avatar was a show that excelled in every department except romance which was whatever. On my second rewatch it was even better. Ok I like Avatar for an incredible magic system world and characters. It’s shocking to me how much content they can fit in 61 episodes. I’m just obsessed with this show. Did I forget the development? Sokka learning women are just housewives. Katara dealing with her mother’s loss better by realizing the man who killed her was pathetic. (Also Sokka but he didn’t go on the adventure). Aang dealing with literal genocide. Zuko living with his abusive father who was the most powerful man in the world pretty much during his tween to young adulthood and so much more.

1.

Adventure Time:

I know that the bar is extremely high but I believe adventure time just flies over it. The development is very slow and subtle. While it is nice this what I love about it. The freedom it has and how it takes it. Every episode we see characters interacting and having fun. We get something new every episode. Yet it all ties in. The amount of effort, love and thought put in is crazy. I love it. I love how it deals with LGBTQ+ relationships by just saying that it's nothing crazy. No one is outcast for it, it's just considered normal. Examples that make a huge deal is Steven Universe, In my opinion adventure time did it 100% better because Ngl I didn’t even know Garnet was gay because Ruby has a deep voice and Sapphire is def a girl especially in her dress. Anyways rant aside this show does everything so right like how Finn accepts himself losing an arm Jerome deciding to live his own life instead of protecting his father's valuables. Jake learns to let go of his pups then realizing that he can’t be absent. And finally I love how it deals with Robot and Creator relationships. Instead of making it scary it shows that if you teach it to respect things then no harm will occur and that it’s better for them to live in bliss than suffering.

Also there's the two secondary characters who are partners and/or best friends. Kimball Cho &amp; Wayne Rigsby, Javier Esposito &amp; Kevin Ryan. In the two examples given, they are detectives. In both cases, the senior partner has a history with special forces, and the junior partners end up having associations with a private firm.

,televisionsuggestions,"Hello, French 28 years old guy here, based on the list below, what would you recommend me?  
I really like Animated TV Shows and comedies.

* Daria
* Futurama
* Misfits
* Please Like Me
* Rick and Morty
* South Park
* That '70s Show
* The Big Bang Theory
* The life and times of Tim
* The Office (US)
* The Simpsons
* Will &amp; Grace

Shows I really like:

* Apple &amp; Onion
* Archer
* Atypical
* Black Mirror
* BoJack Horseman
* Desperate Housewives
* Everything's Gonna Be Okay
* Galavant
* Grace and Frankie
* Jeff &amp; Some Aliens
* Malcolm in the Middle
* Man Seeking Woman (especially season 1)
* Married with children

* Seinfeld
* Six Feet Under
* Stranger Things
* Superjail!
* The end of the fuck\*\*\* life
* The Good Place
* The last man on earth
* Transparent
* Ugly Americans
* Ugly Betty

Acclaimed shows I didn't really liked / wasn't really into it:

* Breaking Bad
* Tried Games of Thrones but haven't passed the first episode!

I really like Ryan Murphy's show, so far I have seen:  
9-1-1 — 9-1-1: Lone Star — American Crime Story — American Horror Story — FEUD — Glee — Pose — Scream Queens (first seasons was one of my favorites things ever!) — The Politician (need to watch season 2)

I also really like British TV Show (and I'm craving for more!! It's been a long time)  
Here is what I've watched so far:  
Absolutely fabulous — Banana / Cucumber — Bad Education — Blackadder — Black Books — Chewing Gum (soooo funny!!) — Fleabag (!!!) — How not to live your life — Inside No. 9 — My Mad Fat Diary — Mr. Bean — Psychoville (meh) — Spaced — The Aliens (mehhhhh) — The IT Crowd — The thin blue line

Never should have watched:

* UnREAL
* In treatment
* 13 reasons why (took me about 6 months to watch the second season, don't think I have faith to watch more!)
* Shameless (US)
* Big Mouth (finished it, but wow, this is B-A-D, right?)

Just started:

* Silicon Valley - Just started season 2, found it really fun to watch so far, the episodes go by very quickly
* Veep - I really liked Julia Louis Dreyfus in Seinfeld so I needed to give it a try, I'm at the end of season 1 and it seems that the show will be a grower the more I dive into it (Gary's the best!)

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Breaking Bad&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tried Games of Thrones but haven&amp;#39;t passed the first episode!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really like Ryan Murphy&amp;#39;s show, so far I have seen:&lt;br/&gt;
9-1-1 — 9-1-1: Lone Star — American Crime Story — American Horror Story — FEUD — Glee — Pose — Scream Queens (first seasons was one of my favorites things ever!) — The Politician (need to watch season 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also really like British TV Show (and I&amp;#39;m craving for more!! It&amp;#39;s been a long time)&lt;br/&gt;
Here is what I&amp;#39;ve watched so far:&lt;br/&gt;
Absolutely fabulous — Banana / Cucumber — Bad Education — Blackadder — Black Books — Chewing Gum (soooo funny!!) — Fleabag (!!!) — How not to live your life — Inside No. 9 — My Mad Fat Diary — Mr. Bean — Psychoville (meh) — Spaced — The Aliens (mehhhhh) — The IT Crowd — The thin blue line&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Never should have watched:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UnREAL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In treatment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;13 reasons why (took me about 6 months to watch the second season, don&amp;#39;t think I have faith to watch more!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shameless (US)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Big Mouth (finished it, but wow, this is B-A-D, right?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just started:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Silicon Valley - Just started season 2, found it really fun to watch so far, the episodes go by very quickly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Veep - I really liked Julia Louis Dreyfus in Seinfeld so I needed to give it a try, I&amp;#39;m at the end of season 1 and it seems that the show will be a grower the more I dive into it (Gary&amp;#39;s the best!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything else I&amp;#39;ve already watched (or still watching for those &amp;quot;too much seasons&amp;quot; show&amp;quot;), some enjoyable shows and some less interesting:&lt;br/&gt;
8 simple rules — AJ and the Queen — Baby Daddy — Bates Motel —Benched — Bored To death — Brickleberry — Crazy Ex-Girlfriend (first 2 seasons I guess were really fun, then it became little less interesting) — Dead Set — Devious Maids — Dexter — Flight of the Conchords — Gravity Falls — Hot Streets — How to make it in America — Huge in France — Hung — Kyle XY — Lazor Wulf — Living with Fran — Locke &amp;amp; Key — Looking — Love — Love, Death &amp;amp; Robots — Moonbeam City — My wife and kids — No ordinary family — Off centre — Over the garden wall — Partners — Phillip K.

&lt;p&gt;I also really liked Seinfeld, Community and Friends with Benefits, but I&amp;#39;m looking for a show where romance/shipping is a more central element of the show (while still being a sitcom).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also unrelated to that, if someone knows a good sitcom like Plebs I&amp;#39;d appreciate it.&lt;/p&gt;

,televisionsuggestions,"Hi! A few weeks ago I finally followed one of the suggestions on someone else’s post and discovered Ted Lasso.
I can’t get enough, I’ve already watched it 3 times and I’m doing my 4th rewatch as I write this (I’m starting to love having it in the background when browsing reddit etc.)

So...since I can’t make a 2nd season magically appear out of thin air, I would love some suggestions.

I would love some good, lighthearted series with some charismatic characters and a “feel-good” approach.
I usually love light/positive comedies, some of my favorites are Friends, Brooklyn Nine-Nine, The Office, Parks and Recreation, Schitt’s Creek, Greek, Scrubs. 
Romance appreciated but absolutely not necessary.

A few weeks ago I finally followed one of the suggestions on someone else’s post and discovered Ted Lasso.
I can’t get enough, I’ve already watched it 3 times and I’m doing my 4th rewatch as I write this (I’m starting to love having it in the background when browsing reddit etc.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So...since I can’t make a 2nd season magically appear out of thin air, I would love some suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would love some good, lighthearted series with some charismatic characters and a “feel-good” approach.
I usually love light/positive comedies, some of my favorites are Friends, Brooklyn Nine-Nine, The Office, Parks and Recreation, Schitt’s Creek, Greek, Scrubs. 
Romance appreciated but absolutely not necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

I’m looking for something of the same ilk. Where people work together to find solutions and characters go through a lot of development.

A good ending is basically a must though because I can’t believe I spent 70h watching The 100 for it to end the way it did. Doesn’t have to be happy at all but preferably should go along with the morals of the show. 

I barely watch tv so even popular Tv shows are ok as recs - I’m in the mood for a more serious show with an interesting plot (drama, sci fi, crime, fantasy, mystery) that has a lot of emotion in it. 

Something I really liked about The 100 was how the women were not over sexualized, no one said any explicitly sexual remarks, men are not shirtless for the sake of it, and most romance developed because of emotional connections rather than sex, so basically I prefer shows without an R rating in that aspect.

,televisionsuggestions,"Looking for that one special show again that gives me a ""just one more episode"" kind of feeling, rather than just being something to pass time with. Luckily I haven't watched too many series in my life, so even if something is an obvious thing everyone has seen, it might be a worthy recommendation for me.  
  
Important: No comedy stuff, I'm more into darker things. Ideally something that ends strong and not something that was great for 5 seasons and then fell apart.
  
**Good examples:**  
  
1. **Game of Thrones:** Great mixture of political scheming and strong characters having to overcome personal demons, I especially loved Tyrion's arc and the way Peter Dinklage portrayed him.  
2. **Breaking Bad:** A clever way of making a criminal story have heart and meaning  
3. **The Haunting of Hill House:** An example of a show that shines so much with its characters that they alone carried it even without a strong pulling narrative. I absolutely loved the horror symbolism and how intimate the show felt.  
4. **Three Kingdoms (2010):** The political scheming felt even better than in GoT due to strong relations of the different kingdoms giving it great dynamics. Characters were super intriguing, though not as much compared to GoT. Still enough to root for them though and an example being stronger on the ""tension side"" can work for me as well.  
5. **The Walking Dead (early seasons):** The tension came from the character's personalities, so that was a formula that worked great for me. However, it dragged on too long and I gave up on the series at some point.  
  
**Negative examples:**  
  
1. **Queen's Gambit:** Following a narcissistic know-it-all just predictably crushing through everyone made me not sympathize with main character and offered 0 tension. Even the ""personal issues"" parts didn't work for me as the presentation didn't feel intimate (last episode was better regarding that...but it was the last episode).  
2. **The Expanse:** Granted I only watched 6 episodes and am planning to finish the first season at least. But what I've seen so far mostly fell apart with what I'd consider weak characters. They seem pretty one-dimensional and I'm not really having strong feelings in any direction for any character, barely even remember their names. Political scheming seems weak because there is no real interaction, just someone saying ""x did y, we can't let that happen"".  
3. **The Haunting of Bly Manor:** No apparent main narrative so that episodes just pass by without progressing anything meaningful. Most characters didn't have much depth to offer regarding story or acting. Owen and Hannah were a big exception here but couldn't save the show for me as mere side characters.

Really enjoying this show. Watched a few episodes back in 2016 but stopped watching it (Started binging another show). Cut to now, I am already on Season 3 after starting it again two days ago. It's got a likeable cast, each episode is enjoyable, and it's just an overall funny show.

&lt;p&gt;Really enjoying this show. Watched a few episodes back in 2016 but stopped watching it (Started binging another show). Cut to now, I am already on Season 3 after starting it again two days ago. It&amp;#39;s got a likeable cast, each episode is enjoyable, and it&amp;#39;s just an overall funny show.&lt;/p&gt;

1. The logic must be good. This means all the clues provided throughout the movie should be inter-connected and should be explained at the later stage how they are connected either directly or indirectly.
2. The movie must appreciate the complexity of human's mind and try to explore different scenarios why people commit crime. It's not as simple as personal A hates person B so person A kill person B.
3. The detective / main protagonist must rely on him/herself to solve the case. This means that the character relies on intuition, logical deduction, reading body language and gathering information to solve crimes, instead of relying on technology like having a computer AI or a full team of nerds in the back office (I just don't like it).
4. Preferably, one case should span several episodes. I don't think that one episode of about 40 minutes runtime is enough for a good case. There should also be an overarching story line that covers each season.

Its very 1930s and 1940s influenced and probably considered a dystopian survival horror.

Somethings I'd like to avoid is teen drama CW type shows and things that are very old (60s and earlier) but I am open minded. Sequals, spinoffs, tv series or anything with a long run time would be prefered.


My needs of content in order of importance are:

1) a steampunk/dieselpunk/art deco visual aesthetic

2) political theory like faulty socialist and libretarian ideology. Very akin to an Ayn Rand novel

3) an isolationed, claustrophobic, meloncolic, post apolocyptic or dystopian feeling

4) intresting and creative technology or technological advancements

5) Horror elements like creatures or killers

6) to not have a happy ending

 bonus) would be somethingc underwater or about a new civilization

I don’t want to spoil too much about the show, but it essentially follows a group of teenagers who work for a secret paranormal investigation known as “The Center.” 

They travel all over Canada (it’s a French/Canadian anime) and occasionally in parts of Europe to solve mysteries, most of which are *extremely* horrifying. (Even rewatching as an adult I get the willies with the animation/lore of certain creatures).

An iconic (for what *I* think is iconic) is one that’s seems to be loosely based off The Shining. It’s a few episodes in to Season 1, but a great one to pull you in with. **S1 E14: Haunting of the Blackwater**

,televisionsuggestions,"I love shows focused on watching a group survive together. And they end up becoming close because of their experiences. And by that I mean platonic relationships, Family and friends.  I'm good with Romance, as long as it's a **subplot** and never overtakes the plot. Although no romance is even better(doubt there are any though).

I also enjoy thriller, supernatural, action, and stuff that have me on the edge of my seat.

So basically shows featuring strong platonic relationships and doesn't exaggerate romance that have action/supernatural thriller(Doesn't have to be English). For example:

(Bolded ones are the ones that perfectly fit the kind of show I want)

* **Teen Wolf**
   * I loved the friendships and the supernatural elements
   * First season had a lot of annoying teenage romance, but it got way better after(I actually was fine with the couple).
   * I love how they handled supernatural beings and occurances
   * I enjoyed how unpredictable it was, I could never tell what was going to happen.
* **The Walking Dead**
   * Kinda got annoyed with the non-stop killing but I enjoyed the group.
   * The zombies were nice
   * Loved the father-son moments between Rick and Carl
   * The romance here was actually okay.
* Stranger Things
   * Second season was the best, the third season was too daily life and romance. Not much seriousness.
* The 100
   * Some characters were annoying and there was a lot of distrust. But I enjoyed the action and friendships.
* Sherlock Holmes
   * Not a group, but I enjoyed the duo.
   * Loved the mystery(even though I never understood until the ending).
* **The Gifted**
   * Superpowers, family, Good guys vs bad guys. Loved this show.
* izombie
   * I've only watched two seasons, don't know if it has a lot of romance later.
   * I like it, it's funny, got super-powered people, and I enjoy murder-mystery.

What I don't like:

* The Vampire Diaries
   * Too much romance, sex, and unnecessary drama.
* Teenage dramas that centre around romance.
* Riverdale
   * No
* Anything with the main genre being Romance
* A lone wolf MC throughout the entire show.

Oh and I don't like sex scenes.

**I also enjoy horror, so feel free to add those.**

,televisionsuggestions," Hello all,

This is my first time posting in this sub. If this sorta post is disallowed, please feel free to flag or remove it.

Anyway, like I said in the title, I'm looking for tv recommendations with romance. The genre need not necessarily be romance per se (although that's perfectly fine), but the show needs to have romance in it. And the romance needs to have at least moderate significance.

I'm especially looking for shows where a single guy, smart/introverted/not very popular with the ladies (at least initially), finds love. Examples of such shows I've watched and loved include Cobra Kai (Miguel x Samantha), Sex Education (Otis x Maeve), Sherlock (the Irene Adler episode, specifically), Death Note (an exception, because I loved the L character, but he never really finds love in the show, as far as I remember), Suits (although Mike wasn't particularly unpopular with the ladies to begin with, the part I most liked about the show was Mike x Rachel), Smallville (Clark x Lois) and The Big Bang Theory (for Sheldon, although I hate him and Amy).

Looking forward to your recommendations.",t2_9hq3v8rk,False,,0,False,"Looking for show recommendations where a single guy who's smart/introverted/not very popular with the ladies (at least initially), finds love.",[],r/televisionsuggestions,False,6,,0,,,False,t3_kyk2hi,False,dark,0.86,,public,5,1,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,5,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1610836950.0,text,6,,,text,self.televisionsuggestions,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello all,&lt;/p&gt;

,televisionsuggestions,"This sub is great for normal people who aren't constantly searching for new stuff. But for those of us with an obsession searching for the next thing to watch, it can get pretty draining when articles pop up titled ""Awesome shows you've NEVER heard of!"" and it lists The Killing, Counterpart, The Americans, etc etc...

So I'm just looking for anything you love that genuinely doesn't come up all that often. Any language is fine. I'll throw a few out:

**Informer**. Currently on Prime in the US. A 6-episode miniseries that looks and feels like a movie, with some excellent performances and a solid plot. It's an interesting mix of on-the-ground police work in London, but centered on cops trying to work informants against terrorists. It's been compared to The Night Of -- which seems a little racist and maybe just based on the stars sharing a similar look -- but there's a similar sense of dread and a beautifully intense setup. It's not the best mystery in the world -- I feel like most viewers will figure out parts of it before you're ""supposed"" to -- but it's also not a show that's dependent on that kind of surprise. Really well done. 

**Undercover**. On Netflix, two seasons, but each season is very serialized and complete. You know how sometimes people say a foreign crime show is awesome, and then you watch it, and at some point you realize that's it's actually pretty dumb but just looks cool and is not in English so it seems classier? This isn't quite that, but it's also not some genre-bending or brilliant piece of writing -- instead it's just a Belgian series that's a bit of trashy fun. Two cops go undercover to catch a crime boss, befriending him at his weekend getaway house at a campground of sorts. There's *tiny* bit of Justified Season 2 in here in the way that the bad guys are somehow both more and less sophisticated than you think they are, and there's a bit of that kind of humor as well. 

**Des**, starring David Tennant. This one got a bit more play so I'm reaching probably calling it under-talked-about, but perhaps (like me) you thought people were talking about *Devs* when they were throwing this out. It's about a real-life serial killer who is captured, and over three hour-long episodes is interviewed and investigated. It gets compared to Mindhunter, which is pretty fair, although I should qualify that I like and don't love Mindhunter.

However, the bug has bit and I'm wanting some nice urban fantasy. Animation is fine, subtitles are iffy (I love foreign media, but I have to be in the right mood to watch something subbed and I'm for sure not doing a live action dub \*shudders\*). I don't want anything grimdark or otherwise hilariously dark. Elements of horror are ok too, but I don't know if I want to go fully into that space after giving myself a couple Sam Esmail and Mike Flanagan chartered head trips. I can be persuaded to do high fantasy or sci-fi, but it's gotta have solid worldbuilding and some sense of mystery and the unknown. Shows and films I've watched and enjoyed that fall into this category- 

• **The Legend of Korra** \- Specifically, I'm a huge fan of ATLA (Who isn't these days?) and love the way this show evolves the setting and continues its use of mundane magic - that is, magic used for everyday things. I also love how it incorporates its Asian aesthetics into 1920s design trends and I'm a sucker for art deco and other 20s aesthetic styles as well. I didn't like the way this show was structured in a seasonal villain way, but enjoyed that each season's conflict had implications for the next. 

**• Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood** \- I loved this show's hard magic system as well, and the way it slowly escalates. It fooled me into thinking it was villain of the week until it started building a very interesting central plot based around a lot of solid intrigue and conspiracy, and the way it slowly escalated until you had &gt;!a giant Lovecraftian nightmare trying to steal the moon!&lt; and everything about it made perfect sense in context was also really cool. 

• **Early Supernatural** \- the sort of neowestern vibe, muscle cars and haunted Americana was really appealing to me for the first five seasons and I gave this show way too many second chances when it got dumb. 

• **Angel** \- What can I say? I love atonement arcs and film noir.

**The first three Pirates of the Caribbean films** \- Yes, it gets a little ridiculous and over the top, but I love a good pirate yarn and I'm also really into the way these films built a setting where the characters and world take superstition and the logic of superstition so seriously. It's a world where you take random junk out of your pockets and call it a piece of eight because it sounds more piratey that way, and for these guys, sounding piratey has weight. And the setting kind of agrees with them. 

• **Basically anything Guillermo Del Toro has ever done**

• **Star Wars** \- It's fantasy. Change my mind. 

I kind of liked, but couldn't fully get into - 

• **Penny Dreadful** \- I watch my shows over dinner. I'm sorry, but, like, maggots are a dealbreaker. Some cool ideas here and I liked the strong literary bend that it has, but a little too much on the gore and sex for my tastes. 

• **Carnival Row** \- I'm watching this one with someone else, and we appear to have put it on indefinite hold, so we liked it, but apparently not enough to keep going immediately after a couple episodes. 

I've ruled out - 

• **His Dark Materials** \- I've heard this gets super anti-religious, and that's not something I'm into. I want to get told I'm stupid for being religious, I can get that just as easily on this very site.

,televisionsuggestions,"Hi,

I'm searching for a serie for my mom. The problem is that she has very difficult tastes, it's difficult to find a compromise. Here are what I would like :

\- Nearly no violence. She can't see anything that have even a bit of blood (medical context is ok). Sex is ok, it's only the violence that she doesn't like at all. Something a bit stressful is ok, but little to no violence. If I can give you a measure, something like Homecoming which is a bit stressful but without any violence is ok, but something like Killing Eve with cold blood murders is not.

\- Not too long. Something that has 8 seasons of 10 hours each is too long, and that discourage her.

\- Not too slow scenario. Too much filler episodes would bore her. The most interesting series are often thrillers, but feature violence. That's where the compromise is difficult to find.

She absolutely loved The Queen's Gambit. I think that's for 2 reasons : First, she loves that 50-60s era and its style. Also, I think she loved getting attached to a single character, and following her through the whole show. I think something that focuses on some characters rather than a lot would get her much more attached to them and making her want to continue.

I'm always in search of good things to recommend to my family, but I have big difficulties to find things for my mother as 99% of the shows I know are too violent.

Thanks in advance for any suggestion, don't hesitate to ask me for more details on a specific point. Have a great day

,televisionsuggestions,"Hi All,

As the title says, I'm looking for shows that have a great ship you can really root for. Two people who are super compatible and have their ups and downs but have great chemistry. They don't necessarily have to end up together in the end. Although that's a plus, the relationship I was rooting for &gt;!(Lee and Kara :( Loved Adama and Roslin as well of course)!&lt; on my favorite show of all time (Battlestar Galactica) never panned out and I still love it.

**Some couples I've really loved are:**

* Ben and Leslie (and April and Andy) in Parks and Rec
* All the couples or not-quite couples in Firefly
* David and Keith in Six Feet Under
* Jaime and Brienne in Game of Thrones (Another one that didn't work out, but I was living for it in seasons 3-7)
* Eleanor and Chidi in the Good Place
* Jake and Amy in Brooklyn 99
* Patrick and David in Schitt's Creek
* My memory's fuzzy but I enjoyed all the various relationships on Freaks and Geeks
* Spike/Buffy and Willow/Tara
* Mindy/Danny on the Mindy Project (at least for a while...)
* Various couples on Sense8

As you can see I definitely like lighter comedies ala Michael Shur, but I am also a big sci-fi/fantasy fan so I'm definitely interested in those kinds of suggestions. Dramas are fine too. Basically, anything with a romance that sucks you in and makes you root for the couple(s). Bonus points if they get together in the end, but if not, there's always fan fiction.

Excited for any suggestions you may have. Oh yes, and I did just binge Bridgerton so I'm open to period stuff as well.

---

# Devs

Finally got caught up on this Goddard Sci-Fi mediation. I really liked all of the actors involved, even with the protagonist's actor reading her lines like a cardboard automation. It looks good, raises some interesting questions and doesn't overstay its welcome.

# The Haunting of Bly Manor

I really liked the spiritual ""prequel"" a lot more as The Haunting of Hill House really brought the horror with some amazing shots and cast. I had the same expectations for Bly Manor and I was left disappointed. It's still a good enough series, I just had misaligned expectations. Hill House was definitely a horror, Bly is much more a mystery drama that also happens to be about ghosts.

# The Mandalorian (Season 2)

It had less magic than the first season but I still enjoyed my time. I liked the expanding of the lore and seeing a lot of character development for Mando. The ending of the season had me torn; on one hand, my inner child was cheering gleefully but my adult half was rolling his eyes at this degree of pandering. I'll still watch the next season and I'll stand by that The Mandalorian is more Star Wars than the sequel trilogies.

# Star Trek: Lower Decks (Season 1)

I guess someone finally realized that they could capitalize on The Orville's success. This is Star Trek in the post-TNG/DS9 universe but played for laughs with the focus being on who would just be extras in any other normal Star Trek series. There's been too many alternative pasts, mirror universes and far-future scenarios to try to make Star Trek easy to be on-boarded within the last iterations. Lower Decks eschews that for the classic but injects fun comedy into the mix.

I also have occasionally broken the loop, including shows I liked a lot, “Person of interest” “The walking dead” “Breaking bad” “better call saul”

I like story rich shows with in depth characters, also if possible a show that’s not afraid to kill of their characters to keep the viewer on edge.

&lt;p&gt;I have a bad habit of picking shows with good beginnings and terrible endings, please help me break this loop!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These shows of which I speak of included “Dexter” (Yes I do look forward to the final seasons reboot) “The rain” “Zoo” “The 100”. (Liked them but turned terrible)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also have occasionally broken the loop, including shows I liked a lot, “Person of interest” “The walking dead” “Breaking bad” “better call saul”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like story rich shows with in depth characters, also if possible a show that’s not afraid to kill of their characters to keep the viewer on edge. &lt;/p&gt;

,televisionsuggestions," I would love to see some epic-fantastic series.

I've been watching Teen wolf. The first season was OK but the second one is dull. The plot has just got down and reduced its charm, engaging content. It's like the intrigue has slumped to a boring level in which the violence and scenes have turned quiet repetitive.

It's been a while since I don't watch a really epic series. One that really gets me excited to watch. The last series that I actually loved was Merlin from BBC.

,televisionsuggestions,"In a discussion about streaming services, people started talking about *Fargo*, and I realized that it has been a long time since I saw a really good series in that caliber. And I really struggle to find one that I haven’t already seen.

Going by my list below, I guess one could say that I like *dark drama* and *crime*, focused on *realism* and that takes place in the *present or semi-present time*. A hint of sci-fi is acceptable, if it still feels realistic, same thing with action.

I leave out comedy/sitcom/humor and cartoons/anime, since those genres are very different and would be best in a separate post.

Also, a *good script* and *good acting* is essential for me. So many series (and movies) have looked good on paper, but fall short on these things.

It is really hard to put a finger on what I really like, but all the ones in my top list have “it”, and I am looking for other series that will give me a similar feeling.

**Creme de la creme:**

* Breaking bad
* House of cards
* Fargo
* Ozark
* Killing Eve (edit)
* Narcos
* Westworld (first 2 seasons)
* The Fall (edit)
* 30 Degrees in February (Swedish, not really dark, but interesting in a different way)
* Better call Saul
* Dexter
* Mr Robot
* Sopranos
* Gomorrah (Italian)
* Handmaid's Tale

**Runners-up:**

* Six Feet Under
* Oz
* The wire
* Big little lies
* Real Humans (Swedish)
* The Rain (Danish)
* Skam (Norwegian)
* The walking dead (first season, or maybe even just the first episode)
* Black mirror (some episodes were good)

**Seem interesting, might watch:**

* The Deuce
* True detective
* Billions

&amp;#x200B;

Below is a list of series that for some reason hasn’t been right for me. It’s **not** a list of “bad” series, they just don’t match my taste or for some other reason didn’t feel right when I watched it. I put it here as some examples, to get a better sense of what I like and dislike.

**Not really my style:**

* Sweet home (my wife loves it though, and is playing in the background right now lol)
* Game of thrones
* Stranger things
* Vikings
* Boardwalk Empire
* Channel Zero
* West Wing
* Deadwood
* LOST
* Band of Brothers
* Taboo
* Rome
* The 100
* Fringe
* Doctor Who
* Supernatural
* Sherlock
* The shield
* Mad men
* Mindhunter
* Star Trek / Farscape / Babylon 5 / Stargate

,televisionsuggestions,"Hi All,

So lately been watching a lot of *gritty* shows... and I find it takes its toll on my emotional wellbeing / mental health for a while after. (For example, after watching season 1 of The Boys... I found myself getting lost in the drama of the show, and feeling angry at certain characters... even though it's just a show. And for days afterward, I still had this uncomfortable ""emotional residue"" after watching it.)

So, I'm looking for suggestions for shows that are more wholesome, lighthearted, or at least generally end on a good note. (That are still engaging and interesting--it's sometimes tricky to balance wholesomeness with being engaging and keeping my interest.)

Some shows that I've liked that are the sort of thing I'm looking for:

Comedy:

* Parks and Recreation
* The Office
* Community (not my fav, but it's okay)

Sci-Fi:

* The Mandalorian
* Star Trek (TNG, DS9, VOY)
* Babylon 5
* Doctor Who

Anime:

* Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood (great mix of wholesomeness, but also engaging enough to be interesting)

&amp;#x200B;

Some shows that I'm not interested in:

* The Good Place
* 30 Rock (just not my style... too many unrelatable characters)
* Psych
* The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel (too drama-y)
* Veep (too cynical; characters too mean to each other)

And for days afterward, I still had this uncomfortable &amp;quot;emotional residue&amp;quot; after watching it.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I&amp;#39;m looking for suggestions for shows that are more wholesome, lighthearted, or at least generally end on a good note. (That are still engaging and interesting--it&amp;#39;s sometimes tricky to balance wholesomeness with being engaging and keeping my interest.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some shows that I&amp;#39;ve liked that are the sort of thing I&amp;#39;m looking for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comedy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Parks and Recreation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Office&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Community (not my fav, but it&amp;#39;s okay)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sci-Fi:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Star Trek (TNG, DS9, VOY)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Babylon 5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doctor Who&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anime:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood (great mix of wholesomeness, but also engaging enough to be interesting)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some shows that I&amp;#39;m not interested in:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Good Place&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;30 Rock (just not my style... too many unrelatable characters)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Psych&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel (too drama-y)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Veep (too cynical; characters too mean to each other)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ty!&lt;/p&gt;

By evil I don’t necessarily mean a cold blooded murder, I mean a character who is morally grey. 
Maybe they have good intentions for themselves but ignore the lives of others? 
A really good example is Breaking Bad.

Like my favourite shows include: Avatar: the Last Airbender (I re watch this every 2 years, it’s my al time favourite, but that could be the nostalgia talking). Dr. Horrible’s Sing Along Blog (is this technically a movie?), Bojack Horseman, The Midnight Gospel, Buffy the Vampire Slayer (and Angel). RWBY was actually really good until after season 3. Also the Chilling Adventures of Sabrina, Merlin, and The Magicians, but I don’t truly enjoy those as much, they just cure the boredom. 

I despise when a show runs too long and storylines become more and more absurd and villains that were scary earlier become easy kill. 

I like it when origins stories and other things aren’t entirely explained and left for the viewer to imagine or if they’re later expanded in comics after the show has ended. (Like how in a:tla, the story is Zuko’s mom is a mystery, but you can read the comics for a full story. Or that the origins of bending aren’t completely concrete (‘the animals taught us’ and ‘they watched the moon’) kind of like early human understanding/explanation of the world.

Also unnecessary sex and romantic side plots bore the f out of me and ruin a show entirely.
