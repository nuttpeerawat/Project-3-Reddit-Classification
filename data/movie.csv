,MovieSuggestions,"# Rules
1. [Be excellent with each other](https://www.reddit.com/r/MovieSuggestions/wiki/index). 

2. Be mindful regarding spoilers. Reddit's universal \&gt;!Spoiler Tags!&lt; are mandatory when discussing plot details of movies.

2. If you wish to be banned, do any of the following: be rude, harass, ignore the subreddit's rules, post about a movie you worked on, promote your blog, promote your app or be a bot. [This subreddit isn't your link farm](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion).

3. Due to Administrators' past actions against this subreddit, we have a **ZERO** tolerance policy regarding piracy. You will be banned if you request links to full features, if you post links to full features, ask how to pirate and inform how to pirate.

4. Submissions must be either Requesting for Help or Suggesting for Movies. Make a new thread, do not Crosspost. Flairs are mandatory. There is a 100 character minimum in posts to ensure quality replies. Familiarize yourself with Barred topics listed below. Television should go to r/televisionsuggestions.

5. Unless the OP has Requested an exhaustive list of a topic, cap your Suggestion List to 25 entries.

6. Link Posts must be to informative sources; such as, Letterboxd, Rotten Tomatos, IMDB or Wikipedia. Media, such as Pictures, Music or Video, must be within a Text Post. Again, be mindful that [this subreddit isn't your link farm](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion).

7. If you wish to Suggest a film, you must do the following:

- Suggest a Single Film
- Include the Film's Title in the Title of the Post
- Do not be a film review; whet the appetite, don't go into detail
- Post a Suggestion only once per 24 hours
- Do not repeat a Suggestion that has been used in the last 3 months
- Do not include barred entries, listed below

# The last Town Hall [was in February](https://www.reddit.com/r/MovieSuggestions/comments/lpwi9y/town_hall_winter_2021_discontinue_top_100_recaps/), the next one will be the last week of May. Participate!

#Optimal Use
This subreddit shouldn't be used for reviews, blindly suggesting lists of movies or just asking for generally universal acclaimed films. Google can easily supply all of those answers. The best way to use this subreddit is understanding that you're leveraging crowdsourcing to identify an itch to scratch. If you don't know specifically what you're looking for, then a Googled question will answer you.

You can easily find top Sci-Fi, Horror, Drama and all of the genres with a search. Someone has already asked and answered so many common requests: Top Korean New Wave, Grounded Science Fiction, Universally Acclaimed Movies, Specific Types of Horror or Thrillers; and so much more. The optimal use of this subreddit is when your question requires a human intelligence. Each time you ask for a movie to watch, the replies will be tailored *exactly for you*. Give as much detail as possible for what you're looking for and you'll be surprised at some of the answers.

#If you think you have a generic question, check [the FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MovieSuggestions/wiki/index#wiki_faq).

This subreddit is not useful for:

- Identifying a Movie: Use /r/tipofmytongue 
- Requesting a TV Series: Use /r/televisionsuggestions 
- Suggest the Creation of a Movie: Use /r/pitchamovie or /r/scriptprompts 
- Asking for How a Scene Was Created: Use /r/Filmmakers 
- Hawking Your Blog/App/Review/YouTube: There's plenty of *other* subreddits for all of these activities.

If you've begun to trust this community with their picks, we do have plenty of Monthly Round-ups of Best Movies:

If you want a quick reply, such as ""What to Watch Tonight"", your best bet is to use our Discord: https://discord.gg/r5tDTrE

It would also be a great way to talk to other cinephiles who are looking for more than the stock answers to every question.

# Barred Suggestions
Barred movies mean that no one should use them as a Suggestion. You can definitely reply to a post if someone wants a movie that suits it. These are films that come up so frequently in post discussions that the community at large is aware about their existence and posting about them is just pandering.

Barred Suggests| | | |
---|---|----|----
12 Angry Men (1957)|Coherence|Donnie Darko|Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind|
John Wick|Knives Out|The Man from Earth|Oldboy (2003)|
Parasite (2019)|The Prestige|Train to Busan|Upgrade|
Whiplash|

&lt;p&gt;If you want a quick reply, such as &amp;quot;What to Watch Tonight&amp;quot;, your best bet is to use our Discord: &lt;a href=""https://discord.gg/r5tDTrE""&gt;https://discord.gg/r5tDTrE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would also be a great way to talk to other cinephiles who are looking for more than the stock answers to every question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Barred Suggestions&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barred movies mean that no one should use them as a Suggestion. You can definitely reply to a post if someone wants a movie that suits it. These are films that come up so frequently in post discussions that the community at large is aware about their existence and posting about them is just pandering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Barred Suggests&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;12 Angry Men (1957)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Coherence&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Donnie Darko&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;John Wick&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Knives Out&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The Man from Earth&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Oldboy (2003)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Parasite (2019)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The Prestige&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Train to Busan&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Upgrade&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Whiplash&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td colspan=""3"" &gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pro Tip&lt;/strong&gt;: This means these movies are &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; good and you should probably check them out.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm looking for films about characters being nostalgic about happy moments in their past and a lost/far away life. It's a bonus if the film can feature moving flashbacks.

The film that comes to my mind is [The Diving Bell and the Butterfly (2007)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Diving_Bell_and_the_Butterfly_(film)) which tells the true story of a former french fashion journalist who becomes fully paralyzed and can only move one eye after an accident. The film focuses on his current struggle and his happy memories and while it sounds like a sad story I don't think the film was that sad.

[Blue Jasmine (2013)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Jasmine) by Woody Allen is another great example of what I'm looking for.

,MovieSuggestions,"Hi all,

I'm after suggestions for modern Sci-Fi movies that try to be accurate to the science - or at least plausible to what our current understanding of the Universe says.

A perfect example being ""Interstellar"" and it's portrayal of General Relativity, Time Dilation &amp; Interstellar wormhole travel - this being largely due to the involvement of theoretical physicist, Kip Thorne.

Or ""Contact"", which was adapted from the book written by arguably one of the best-known scientists of the 20th century, Carl Sagan.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't mind a bit of artistic license where it makes sense, for example the inconsistent gravity in ""The Martian"", where it was accurate to Mars when he's outside (approx. 40% of Earth) yet Earth-like when he's in the hab - apparently this was a creative decision as it looked too jarring when Matt Damon's character wasn't in his suit.

On the other hand, space fire that acts like it does on earth, despite being in a vacuum, is particularly annoying.

I get no movie is perfect and mostly get some things right, some wrong, i.e... ""Gravity"" and it's accurate portrayal of fire, but it changes the orbits of the ISS and Hubble telescope to be next to each other?

&amp;#x200B;

Whilst I do enjoy them the most, it doesn't necessarily have to be space-based as movies like ""Arrival"" are just as fascinating where Amy Adams' character never leaves the ground.

&amp;#x200B;

If any one has any good time travel movies, I'll take those too. Especially those that explore the relationship between time, space and gravity.

Or, anything about the block universe theory, or 4th dimensional travel.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance.

&lt;p&gt;I know Kurosawa is like the legend of older war movies, but those are just too old for my picky tastes unfortunately.

,MovieSuggestions,"Hi! 

My partner and I watch a film every Friday night. We started back in July to try and help with the boredom of lockdown. It's a no phone zone and something to look forward to in the week. I pick a movie one Friday and she picks the movie the following Friday.

It's my turn this week and I'm running out of ideas but thought I'd ask for a suggestion. I like most genres but really fancy a Thriller/Horror/Mystery type film at the moment. For Horrors I would love a genuinely terrifying one but I'm also a big fan of that uneasy certain films give you (Get Out, Us etc).

I'll list the films we watched and our marks out of 10 to give an idea of what we have seen. I'll refer to us as Me &amp; Her :D Hopefully this can also act as a decent suggestion guide as well.

Thank you all in advance!

,MovieSuggestions,"Had great help rediscovering this movie over at r/tipofmytongue. And an extra tip about Lassiter.

Probably due to everything being more exciting and surprising when I was young, and me getting older, I am starting too feel that ""they just don't make them like they used to"". There are still great movies made today but specifically when it comes to high adventure movies we just don't get them that much anymore.

Basically I miss Dino De Laurentiis...

Movies like Conan, King Kong (with Jeff)and Dune, among plenty of others, I feel have this larger than life production value to them. The same thing with High Road To China as I remember it from my youth (I'm doing a Tom Selleck marathon soon to rewatch it). These movies didn't always have the best acting or plot, but they are always incredibly enjoyable to watch over and over again. There are some more modern equivalents like the first The Mummy movie, Prisoner Of Azkaban, Big Fish and Stardust, that I have really enjoyed, but I feel more time is passing between each one. Sure we got the Marvel universe with some great movies but they are often too long, just to squeeze in 20 plot lines linking to other upcoming movies, and I just don't get the same feeling as I do from the stand alone movies.

So with that in mind what are some other great, and maybe forgotten 70s and 80s high adventure movies?

,MovieSuggestions,"When I was a teenager, prior to everyone having streaming services, I got a movie suggestion from a really good friend who worked at Blockbuster (yeah I’m old, what of it?). It was True Romance...written by Quentin Tarantino and directed by Tony Scott. The cast list alone made it a movie I wanted to watch. Christian Slater, Patricia Arquette, Christopher Walken, Dennis Hopper, Brad Pitt, Samuel L. Jackson, Val Kilmer, and one of my favorite and underrated actor Gary Oldman.
Prior to watching the film, my stupid ass drank a bunch of alcohol and if I got further than 15 minutes in, I couldn’t tell you. I remembered the very beginning, but for some reason, believed that the rest of the movie sucked. I had no reason for feeling this way beyond almost getting alcohol poisoning and the movie playing while I got sick.

It was True Romance...written by Quentin Tarantino and directed by Tony Scott. The cast list alone made it a movie I wanted to watch. Christian Slater, Patricia Arquette, Christopher Walken, Dennis Hopper, Brad Pitt, Samuel L. Jackson, Val Kilmer, and one of my favorite and underrated actor Gary Oldman.
Prior to watching the film, my stupid ass drank a bunch of alcohol and if I got further than 15 minutes in, I couldn’t tell you. I remembered the very beginning, but for some reason, believed that the rest of the movie sucked. I had no reason for feeling this way beyond almost getting alcohol poisoning and the movie playing while I got sick.

Feeling like a bit of a vegetable, I want to pass a few hours.

I don't have a really specific notion, I can't think of anything I want to see but haven't off the top of my head. I don't want to think or pay too much attention though.

Maybe like an amusing action movie, that is well respected for being exactly that and nothing more. Like John-Wick vibe.

Or a decent comedy/drama with a bit of pace. I enjoyed Blow the Man Down and Captain Fantastic recently.

,MovieSuggestions,"I'd describe the general vibe I'm after as having late 90s/early oughties aesthetics with quirky, somewhat flawed, but realistic and relatable characters and realistic storylines. In particular, it's unlike Wes Anderson films which are certainly aesthetically pleasing (almost by the numbers by this point, what with his signature use of symmetrical shots and bright colours) and *do have* the quirkiness factor (sometimes *too much*, edging on kooky and annoying) but I find tend to seem unrealistic and have a very vivid, high-def quality to them, especially his newer films.

The films you might suggest don't necessarily have to be from that era though, but there's something about the films I mentioned above that make them look bright, somewhat low-def, grainy and dream-like that I also quite enjoy (maybe a combination of the lighting, cameras and film used being particular to the era?

,MovieSuggestions,Lake Mungo directed by Joel Anderson is a really underrated horror movie that deserves more recognition. It's not a perfect film but It is also not filled with cheap jump scares and clichéd elements like most horror films nowadays.

I define good movies to be 8+ or if you abhor grades, the top 20% of movies you've ever seen. Films listed here will be added to the subreddit's [Top 100](https://www.reddit.com/r/MovieSuggestions/wiki/meta/top100). What are the top films you saw in February 2021 and why?  Here are my picks:

---

# Song of the Sea (2014)

Song of the Sea eventually won me over. I initially didn't like the art style and I found the child protagonists to be grating. Gradually, I was entranced by Song's style but my focus was more on the story. Irish mythology is woefully underrepresented in media, so it was amazing to see it committed to screen. As soon as the tale abandoned the childish sibling rivalry and focused on myth, Song of the Sea turned into an excellent adventure movie.

,MovieSuggestions,"hello all,

I watched **Nell (1994)** where Jodie Foster plays a feral child who's invented her own language and has had no communication with the outside world. I thought that movie's premise was interesting and thought-provoking even if the actual movie slid too far into melodrama. I also watched **The Miracle Worker (1962)** after that about Helen Keller and how Helen was taught to communicate or to understand words. That movie was a lot more concise and clean in executing its goals than Nell was and I thought The Miracle Worker did a good job getting across the gist of how H.K. was taught to communicate. I also watched Room a few years ago and it was cool/i think it fits here..even if that movie was more about the emotions of the characters than the psychological/philosophical side of things.

Anyway, I'd be interested in seeing any more movies about feral children or people who have their own language which other people try to decipher/understand..or about people who have a limited understanding of the outside world and how they perceive the world as a result. I plan to watch **Truffaut's The Wild Child (1970)**, and I may watch **Mockingbird Don't Sing (2001)** which was based on the real life case of Genie Wiley....but aside from that nothing appeals to me/fits my needs. I also wouldn't mind if the characters are adults rather than children or if they're not physically cut off/isolated but only isolated and cut off in a sensory way..or if they're just perfectly healthy people cut off who are cut off from civilisation rather than disabled people.

""Drama, Thriller

A well-respected businessman is sometimes controlled by his murder and mayhem-loving alter ego.""

There's a lot of class to Costner's performance and I'd recommend seeing this if you want to see a great actor delivering great acting in general. He's supported nicely by William Hurt who is having a blast as an anonymous phycological parasite.

Moore is a cop who suspects something isn't quite right in suburbia, and she ain't wrong. There's a serial killer around but he's hiding inside a veil of respectability and polish. And how *do* you catch someone hiding inside someone else.

This film is on ""underrated"" lists yet has a healthy review score. It's got big name actors but no one has seen it. This is one of those films that falls into gem territory I reckon.

,MovieSuggestions,"Whilst searching on streaming services (Netflix/Amazon Instant Video), more often than not, we've just ended up watching a lot of mediocre stuff that's mainly marketed at children and therefore doesn't appeal to me as all that interesting or engaging, for example:

* Benji
* Pets United  \[**awful**\]
* Beethoven
* Pee Wee's Big Holiday
* Storks
* Christmas Break In \[**awful\]**
* The Queen's Corgi  \[**awful\]**
* The BFG (2016)
* Johnny English 1/Reborn/ Strikes Again
* The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas
* Nativity 2: Danger in the Manger \[**awful\]**
* Gnomeo &amp; Juliet/Sherlock Gnomes
* 48 Christmas Wishes \[**awful\]**
* Paul Blart: Mall Cop
* Richie Rich

However, we have discovered some gems that we've all really enjoyed:

* Hugo
* Lala Land
* The usual Pixar stuff (Incredibles, Ratatouille, Toy Story etc.)
* Shrek/Shrek 2
* Groundhog Day
* Matilda
* Coming to America (me and my Dad both really enjoyed it, but my Mum left the room due to all the F words!)
* Shaun the Sheep: Farmageddon

Likewise we've watched some stuff, which I've quite enjoyed, but neither of my parents liked:

* Coco
* Labyrinth
* Casino Royale
* The Hunger Games: Catching Fire

**My Dad** likes: heart-warming tales, light-heartedness, and dislikes themes of dystopia, darkness, violence or corruption as it makes him become cynical about human nature. He also doesn't like fast moving giddy action films as he can't keep up with them. He is highly empathic and so has a very strong sensory reaction to situations which are depicted on screen: even though they aren't real, I think he experiences them in his mind as if they *are* real.

**My Mum** likes: musicals, costume dramas, and especially dislikes films which are morally dubious with excessive swearing, sex or violence in. She also dislikes films which are not rooted firmly in the real world or that have complicated and deep storylines that one cannot keep up with, as they make her head hurt.

**I like:** films which make you think or which have deep, complex and interlocking storylines. I like to be on the edge of my seat whether that be through white-knuckle peril, or a deep mystery. I have great admiration for the fantastic, the mystical, the non-linear, and for sci-fi. I particularly enjoy thrillers and physiological thrillers. I also have time for genuinely well-made movies of any genre, which stimulate one's emotions in a mature and adult way.

So you can see how we are the direct opposite in terms of our tastes in movies! So based on this, can you recommend me some good movies, which are maturely made and stimulating, but that are not too morally dubious, and that we'd all enjoy.

Plot subversions always help, too, so long as they fit within the universe and characters.

Liked (In no particular order):
-Uncut Gems
-Parasite
-Argo

-Arrival
-The Gentlemen
-Kingsman
-Nightcrawler

Neutral on:
-Tenet
-Bad Boys III (Really, this was a terrible movie, but somehow it was so bad that I kinda like it? Like a guilty pleasure.)
-Boys State
-Bad Education
-The Gift (Good movie, but a little scary/sad for my partner)

Disliked:
-The Nest (wtf was this?)
-The Matrix (hot take, I know, but I'd argue it has all the issues I mentioned above)
-High Life (couldn't hear or understand the main character, fell asleep 25 minutes in)

&lt;p&gt;And quite a few other mind bending noir style movies. Im hoping some ones i havent seen pop up here. Bonus points if the endings are well done. Just watched Only God Forgives and if its ending wasnt shit, it would have gone on this list. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry i cant be more specific with what im looking for. Thanks in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

,MovieSuggestions,"Hi :) my fiancé and I are currently watching Knives Out and I think I’m enjoying it (seeming like a cop out ending). And cluedo is one of my favourite games 😍 can anyone recommend any good “whodunnit” movies (without lame copouts please!!!!) or just more mystery (eg. Gone girl). I love this movie, I think it was called hide and seek maybe, where a girl gets married and that night they all start trying to kill her because of a “game” before she escapes. Well I should say liked because the supernatural crap ruined it for me. 

Any and all recommendations are welcome :) obviously no spoilers please :p 

I’m in Australia and have Stan, Netflix and Amazon Prime. But if a movie sounds really great then I’m happy to pay a few dollars to buy or rent it online :)

&lt;p&gt;Anybody know anything like this, more sci than fi, discovery, non-violent etc??   &lt;/p&gt;

Random things have cropped up on my radar over the last couple months.

# Abolish 3 Month Limit for Suggestions?
u/yellingtrees didn't like that there was a three month limit for Suggestions. I think he's taking crazy pills, as otherwise we'd have to expand the Barred list which I'm not in favour of and I feel like people would get very circlejerky over constantly posting the same boring hits. But every dog deserves its day in the sun; is the community in favour of removing the 3 month limit for Suggestions? Or is this the case of a 'Drive By Poster' who thinks they knows best and then never participates again?

# Authentic Answers Only
I'm a little sad that I feel like this should be a rule as I thought it should be implied with Rule 1: Be excellent with each other. The amount of nonhelpful Top Comments have only grown with the subreddit's expansion. If y'all wanna circlejerk or eat popcorn, do it outside of the Top Comment, as long as it also follows rule 1. Hell, we might need to rework all of the rules to spell things out *even more* as we start receiving the 'bottom half of the bell curve' with the subreddit's expansion.

# Barred
Barred movies are films that this community is very much aware of, posting them is just pandering. Being Barred means the movie shouldn't be used in a Blue Suggesting Post. You can definitely reply to Red Requesting posts with the movies if the Barred film suits the request. 

For reference, here's everything barred:

Barred Suggests| | | |
---|---|----|----
12 Angry Men (1957)|Coherence|Contagion|Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind|
Donnie Darko|John Wick|Knives Out|Oldboy (2003)|
Parasite (2019)|The Prestige|Train to Busan|Upgrade|
Whiplash|Your Name|

I think it is safe to remove Your Name and Contagion from the list. Your Name because the fever for it has seemingly cooled and Contagion because it's been a year and its interest due to Corona has long ago peaked. Yay or nay?

I've noticed that The Man from Earth gets suggested like clockwork and so I think it is fair to get Barred. A user suggested that Fight Club get Barred. I'm a little shocked that it *isn't* Barred but people don't really Suggest it. I'd prefer not to because I want this list to be as short as possible but it is an infamous movie. Thoughts?

# Discontinue Top 100 Recaps?

I don't know about y'all but I find the monthly round ups to be incredibly useful for finding great movies. That metamorphized into the Top 100 project because I got tired of answering the ""What does the subreddit think is the best?"" and we're all listicle junkies so that's just another fun thing to look at. Plus it'll help guide those who want to watch generically good movies from movie goers who aren't too terribly influenced by reviews. Initially, I thought the Top 100 Recaps after every monthly vote would be useful for those who want to know what climbed, dived or appeared. Participation is low so I'm not too sure if I should continue them; perhaps just trim it to the facts instead of editorializing?

# Eliminate 25 Suggestion Limit

This is a contentious rule. It was the compromise from the ""Listers"" to ""No Listers"". From the over 25 Suggestions I've removed in the last few months, none of them seemed malicious; I lay the blame purely on OP. When I use this subreddit for [my own movie hunting](https://www.reddit.com/r/MovieSuggestions/comments/gfnf5o/2000s_onwards_movies_with_concepts_that_i_avoided/), I found that the massive list was the exception and not the rule. That's because I was very precise for what I liked and what I wanted. That's why we're toying with the idea of pushing those generic requests to /r/ifyoulikeblank.

# FAQ
The FAQ has grown with these new categories of questions I've noticed that get asked over and over again.

- Anti-Establishment
- Body Horror
- Christmas Movies
- Found Footage
- Mockumentary
- Non-Stop Action
- Philosophical
- Puberty Monster
- Watch Once

# FAQ Category Eliminations

There's too many categories for the FAQ to really be useful. It's getting to the point where its everything under the sun. That's not sustainable. I think moving to a 'close ended' question would be more useful. After all, it's easy to point someone to Zombie, Apocalypse or Found Footage movies. Those are close ended Requests. But where do we stop with Psychological Thrillers? Or Horror Comedies? Those are *genres*. The list can go on forever.

So far, I think it is safe to eliminate:

- Arthouse
- Documentary
- Horror Comedy
- Martial Arts
- Mindfuck
- Psychological Horror
- Psychological Thriller
- Romcom
- Slasher
- Watch Once

I can see Mindfuck being a controversial elimination but how often do you find yourself rolling your eyes and telling them to check the FAQ vs. gleefully answer your favourite twist ending movies?

# Grandfathering and Removing IMDB

The other mods and I volunteer our time to make this a nice corner of Internet garden. This means we've been removing a lot of spam from 'influencers' who just want to make bank - including some of the most asinine and poorly thought out excuses I've heard. I'd be welcoming 'dog ate my homework' at this rate. Movies are a highly monetized space and so we've been trying to keep the subreddit as ad free as possible. Hence the rule for only 'informative sources' like Letterboxd, RT, IMDB or Wiki. Unfortunately, IMDB has expanded to start being a monetized space, so it's no longer as neutral as it comes. The plan here is to have warnings that in six months we'll be disallowing IMDB links and then close the door. Blame corporate overreach in public spaces as they desire for more revenue streams? ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

# More Mods
With the subreddit growing, it looks like we might need more eyes on this. After all, /u/gonzoforpresident, /u/001Guy001 and I do have to at least pretend we have lives outside of serving this subreddit 24/7. 001Guy's AutoMod wizardry certainly helps but we're all NA posters, so we might need some backup on the other side of the globe so there's less 'Mods are Asleep' shenanigans. Please send an application through Mod Mail; preference will be given to Quality Posters because it means that you're at least devious enough to play the long game or are genuinely interested in the subreddit's wellbeing.

# Piracy and YouTube

In our quest to get the Admins to answer where the line on piracy lays, we've had to disallow YouTube. The crux of the issue is that as long as we have 'reasonable effort' to remove piracy, the subreddit is OK. The problem is that reasonable sounds nice as a platitude, it means crap all for precedent settings; especially since this subreddit has been quarantined in the past due to rampant piracy and Reddit will ban rule following subreddits for inconveniencing them in the media. Just because something is on YouTube doesn't mean it's legal, especially with different region zones, lost of copyright, or just blatant copyright infringement. And yeah, that includes trailers, apparently those are getting copyrighted as well. I think it's idiocy but I'm not a marketing executive, so what the hell do I know? What I do know is that to protect the subreddit, we're going to no longer allow YT links - sorry guys, Reddit lost its wild west ways years ago.

# Point to /r/ifyoulikeblank 

The purpose of this subreddit is to find that itch you never knew it could be scratched. Is there a magical tech noir (Yes, it's Cast a Deadly Spell), a meta philosophical critique of life (Yes, The Holy Mountains) or the like. But sometimes people post such a generic list of movies they like, without saying what they're looking for, that I think the best thing to do is just remove the thread and point them towards /r/ifyoulikeblank. There's only so many movie lists I can see that include Inception, Goodfellas and Jurassic Park with asking what else they'd like before I want to head desk. I feel like this would also eliminate people erroneously posting tons of suggestions.

# Quality Posters
You may have noticed that some users have a 'Quality Poster 👍'  Flair. This is to honour those who spend time to make the Subreddit work with their frequent on-topic Suggestions. It's a way to recognize their work and it's a nice way to know if someone's Suggestions are good. These are users I've noticed contributing a lot over the last three months and so they get their Quality Poster Flair:

- /u/djsosonut 
- /u/laughinggor108 
- /u/mammothease
- /u/pigs-onthe-wing  
- /u/platypus-man 
- /u/stinkybrittches 
- /u/tb54 

The rough methodology I use is that Upvote good comments and the Reddit Enchancement Suite keeps track of Upvotes. Once I've noticed someone has accumulated 10 Upvotes, I Tag them for evaluation in the next Town Hall. When I evaluate someone, I check to see if the Upvotes came from /r/MovieSuggestions Subreddit instead of perhaps from somewhere else - I do believe in courtesy Upvoting so people get their pluses from me. If they've been active for the last few weeks and the upvotes are from this Subreddit, I apply the 'Quality Poster ' Flair in the next Town Hall.

# Reviews
We've been hit by big reviews that got people real testy when we removed them. After all, this is /r/MovieSuggestions and not r/movies, r/flicks, r/truefilm, /r/moviereviews or r/moviecritic. I think a two or three sentence explanation of why you should watch a movie is enough to whet the appetite and know if it is right for the audience. Yet people would write massive, multiparagraph movie reviews and be annoyed they couldn't post them here. Hell, we even tried /r/moviediscussions as a spinoff for people to discuss the particulars of movies but that subreddit has died an ignoble death. How does the community feel about allowing these big reviews? Would it help you find the movies you want to see, or is this a case of pushy 'Drive By Posters'?

# State of the Subreddit

Every New Year, I would message the two moderators above me if they'd like to start taking the reigns, participating or if they could step down. I'd been ignored for three years running but for some reason, the stars aligned and both replied. I asked the top guy if he could remove the below, himself and what's his favourite movie. Then the second replied. A day or two later, I found that the top moderator removed both of them and his favourite movie was Syndoche, New York. Whoops, sorry second dude. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

With my newfound power, I obviously started to immediately abuse it by doing pretty much the same as I already did: removed posts, participated when I had the time and getting asinine arguments with spammers over why they should only be banned for two weeks. Though this did mean I could ask an Admin I know if he could answer the piracy question. To which he said, he wasn't the best to contact over this and he would get back to me. It's been over a month but hey, at least I got *an* Admin to recognize that I have a question. We'll have to wait for responses.

Otherwise, the subreddit has grown to 221k from 187k four months ago in the last Town Hall. That's a 18% increase if I'm remembering my Grade 9 math correctly. But I don't trust that, so I Googled it. I promised this would be shorter so I'm ending here.

Hell, we might need to rework all of the rules to spell things out &lt;em&gt;even more&lt;/em&gt; as we start receiving the &amp;#39;bottom half of the bell curve&amp;#39; with the subreddit&amp;#39;s expansion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Barred&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barred movies are films that this community is very much aware of, posting them is just pandering. Being Barred means the movie shouldn&amp;#39;t be used in a Blue Suggesting Post. You can definitely reply to Red Requesting posts with the movies if the Barred film suits the request. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For reference, here&amp;#39;s everything barred:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Barred Suggests&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;12 Angry Men (1957)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Coherence&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Contagion&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Donnie Darko&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;John Wick&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Knives Out&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Oldboy (2003)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Parasite (2019)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The Prestige&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Train to Busan&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Upgrade&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Whiplash&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Your Name&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td colspan=""2"" &gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it is safe to remove Your Name and Contagion from the list. Your Name because the fever for it has seemingly cooled and Contagion because it&amp;#39;s been a year and its interest due to Corona has long ago peaked. Yay or nay?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve noticed that The Man from Earth gets suggested like clockwork and so I think it is fair to get Barred. A user suggested that Fight Club get Barred. I&amp;#39;m a little shocked that it &lt;em&gt;isn&amp;#39;t&lt;/em&gt; Barred but people don&amp;#39;t really Suggest it. I&amp;#39;d prefer not to because I want this list to be as short as possible but it is an infamous movie. Thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Discontinue Top 100 Recaps?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know about y&amp;#39;all but I find the monthly round ups to be incredibly useful for finding great movies. That metamorphized into the Top 100 project because I got tired of answering the &amp;quot;What does the subreddit think is the best?&amp;quot; and we&amp;#39;re all listicle junkies so that&amp;#39;s just another fun thing to look at. Plus it&amp;#39;ll help guide those who want to watch generically good movies from movie goers who aren&amp;#39;t too terribly influenced by reviews. Initially, I thought the Top 100 Recaps after every monthly vote would be useful for those who want to know what climbed, dived or appeared. Participation is low so I&amp;#39;m not too sure if I should continue them; perhaps just trim it to the facts instead of editorializing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Eliminate 25 Suggestion Limit&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a contentious rule. It was the compromise from the &amp;quot;Listers&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;No Listers&amp;quot;. From the over 25 Suggestions I&amp;#39;ve removed in the last few months, none of them seemed malicious; I lay the blame purely on OP. When I use this subreddit for &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/MovieSuggestions/comments/gfnf5o/2000s_onwards_movies_with_concepts_that_i_avoided/""&gt;my own movie hunting&lt;/a&gt;, I found that the massive list was the exception and not the rule. That&amp;#39;s because I was very precise for what I liked and what I wanted. That&amp;#39;s why we&amp;#39;re toying with the idea of pushing those generic requests to &lt;a href=""/r/ifyoulikeblank""&gt;/r/ifyoulikeblank&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;FAQ&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FAQ has grown with these new categories of questions I&amp;#39;ve noticed that get asked over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anti-Establishment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Body Horror&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Christmas Movies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Found Footage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mockumentary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Non-Stop Action&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Philosophical&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Puberty Monster&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watch Once&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;FAQ Category Eliminations&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s too many categories for the FAQ to really be useful. It&amp;#39;s getting to the point where its everything under the sun. That&amp;#39;s not sustainable. I think moving to a &amp;#39;close ended&amp;#39; question would be more useful. After all, it&amp;#39;s easy to point someone to Zombie, Apocalypse or Found Footage movies. Those are close ended Requests. But where do we stop with Psychological Thrillers? Or Horror Comedies? Those are &lt;em&gt;genres&lt;/em&gt;. The list can go on forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, I think it is safe to eliminate:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arthouse&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Documentary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Horror Comedy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Martial Arts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mindfuck&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Psychological Horror&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Psychological Thriller&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Romcom&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slasher&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watch Once&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can see Mindfuck being a controversial elimination but how often do you find yourself rolling your eyes and telling them to check the FAQ vs. gleefully answer your favourite twist ending movies?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Grandfathering and Removing IMDB&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other mods and I volunteer our time to make this a nice corner of Internet garden. This means we&amp;#39;ve been removing a lot of spam from &amp;#39;influencers&amp;#39; who just want to make bank - including some of the most asinine and poorly thought out excuses I&amp;#39;ve heard. I&amp;#39;d be welcoming &amp;#39;dog ate my homework&amp;#39; at this rate. Movies are a highly monetized space and so we&amp;#39;ve been trying to keep the subreddit as ad free as possible. Hence the rule for only &amp;#39;informative sources&amp;#39; like Letterboxd, RT, IMDB or Wiki. Unfortunately, IMDB has expanded to start being a monetized space, so it&amp;#39;s no longer as neutral as it comes. The plan here is to have warnings that in six months we&amp;#39;ll be disallowing IMDB links and then close the door. Blame corporate overreach in public spaces as they desire for more revenue streams? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;More Mods&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the subreddit growing, it looks like we might need more eyes on this. After all, &lt;a href=""/u/gonzoforpresident""&gt;/u/gonzoforpresident&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=""/u/001Guy001""&gt;/u/001Guy001&lt;/a&gt; and I do have to at least pretend we have lives outside of serving this subreddit 24/7. 001Guy&amp;#39;s AutoMod wizardry certainly helps but we&amp;#39;re all NA posters, so we might need some backup on the other side of the globe so there&amp;#39;s less &amp;#39;Mods are Asleep&amp;#39; shenanigans. Please send an application through Mod Mail; preference will be given to Quality Posters because it means that you&amp;#39;re at least devious enough to play the long game or are genuinely interested in the subreddit&amp;#39;s wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Piracy and YouTube&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our quest to get the Admins to answer where the line on piracy lays, we&amp;#39;ve had to disallow YouTube. The crux of the issue is that as long as we have &amp;#39;reasonable effort&amp;#39; to remove piracy, the subreddit is OK. The problem is that reasonable sounds nice as a platitude, it means crap all for precedent settings; especially since this subreddit has been quarantined in the past due to rampant piracy and Reddit will ban rule following subreddits for inconveniencing them in the media. Just because something is on YouTube doesn&amp;#39;t mean it&amp;#39;s legal, especially with different region zones, lost of copyright, or just blatant copyright infringement. And yeah, that includes trailers, apparently those are getting copyrighted as well. I think it&amp;#39;s idiocy but I&amp;#39;m not a marketing executive, so what the hell do I know? What I do know is that to protect the subreddit, we&amp;#39;re going to no longer allow YT links - sorry guys, Reddit lost its wild west ways years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Point to &lt;a href=""/r/ifyoulikeblank""&gt;/r/ifyoulikeblank&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this subreddit is to find that itch you never knew it could be scratched. Is there a magical tech noir (Yes, it&amp;#39;s Cast a Deadly Spell), a meta philosophical critique of life (Yes, The Holy Mountains) or the like. But sometimes people post such a generic list of movies they like, without saying what they&amp;#39;re looking for, that I think the best thing to do is just remove the thread and point them towards &lt;a href=""/r/ifyoulikeblank""&gt;/r/ifyoulikeblank&lt;/a&gt;. There&amp;#39;s only so many movie lists I can see that include Inception, Goodfellas and Jurassic Park with asking what else they&amp;#39;d like before I want to head desk. I feel like this would also eliminate people erroneously posting tons of suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Quality Posters&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may have noticed that some users have a &amp;#39;Quality Poster 👍&amp;#39;  Flair. This is to honour those who spend time to make the Subreddit work with their frequent on-topic Suggestions. It&amp;#39;s a way to recognize their work and it&amp;#39;s a nice way to know if someone&amp;#39;s Suggestions are good. These are users I&amp;#39;ve noticed contributing a lot over the last three months and so they get their Quality Poster Flair:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""/u/djsosonut""&gt;/u/djsosonut&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""/u/laughinggor108""&gt;/u/laughinggor108&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""/u/mammothease""&gt;/u/mammothease&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""/u/pigs-onthe-wing""&gt;/u/pigs-onthe-wing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""/u/platypus-man""&gt;/u/platypus-man&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""/u/stinkybrittches""&gt;/u/stinkybrittches&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""/u/tb54""&gt;/u/tb54&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rough methodology I use is that Upvote good comments and the Reddit Enchancement Suite keeps track of Upvotes. Once I&amp;#39;ve noticed someone has accumulated 10 Upvotes, I Tag them for evaluation in the next Town Hall. When I evaluate someone, I check to see if the Upvotes came from &lt;a href=""/r/MovieSuggestions""&gt;/r/MovieSuggestions&lt;/a&gt; Subreddit instead of perhaps from somewhere else - I do believe in courtesy Upvoting so people get their pluses from me. If they&amp;#39;ve been active for the last few weeks and the upvotes are from this Subreddit, I apply the &amp;#39;Quality Poster &amp;#39; Flair in the next Town Hall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Reviews&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve been hit by big reviews that got people real testy when we removed them. After all, this is &lt;a href=""/r/MovieSuggestions""&gt;/r/MovieSuggestions&lt;/a&gt; and not &lt;a href=""/r/movies""&gt;r/movies&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=""/r/flicks""&gt;r/flicks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=""/r/truefilm""&gt;r/truefilm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=""/r/moviereviews""&gt;/r/moviereviews&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=""/r/moviecritic""&gt;r/moviecritic&lt;/a&gt;. I think a two or three sentence explanation of why you should watch a movie is enough to whet the appetite and know if it is right for the audience. Yet people would write massive, multiparagraph movie reviews and be annoyed they couldn&amp;#39;t post them here. Hell, we even tried &lt;a href=""/r/moviediscussions""&gt;/r/moviediscussions&lt;/a&gt; as a spinoff for people to discuss the particulars of movies but that subreddit has died an ignoble death. How does the community feel about allowing these big reviews? Would it help you find the movies you want to see, or is this a case of pushy &amp;#39;Drive By Posters&amp;#39;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;State of the Subreddit&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every New Year, I would message the two moderators above me if they&amp;#39;d like to start taking the reigns, participating or if they could step down. I&amp;#39;d been ignored for three years running but for some reason, the stars aligned and both replied. I asked the top guy if he could remove the below, himself and what&amp;#39;s his favourite movie. Then the second replied. A day or two later, I found that the top moderator removed both of them and his favourite movie was Syndoche, New York. Whoops, sorry second dude. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With my newfound power, I obviously started to immediately abuse it by doing pretty much the same as I already did: removed posts, participated when I had the time and getting asinine arguments with spammers over why they should only be banned for two weeks. Though this did mean I could ask an Admin I know if he could answer the piracy question. To which he said, he wasn&amp;#39;t the best to contact over this and he would get back to me. It&amp;#39;s been over a month but hey, at least I got &lt;em&gt;an&lt;/em&gt; Admin to recognize that I have a question. We&amp;#39;ll have to wait for responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, the subreddit has grown to 221k from 187k four months ago in the last Town Hall. That&amp;#39;s a 18% increase if I&amp;#39;m remembering my Grade 9 math correctly. But I don&amp;#39;t trust that, so I Googled it. I promised this would be shorter so I&amp;#39;m ending here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s all I can think of that were problems over the last couple months. If you can think of anything else, post &amp;#39;em below. Respond to any of the topics you feel comfortable talking about and your opinion. We&amp;#39;ll hash something out. Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

,MovieSuggestions,"I'm curious to see what movies are worth revisiting from a different point of view. This could be because of the different times we are in, but I mostly want to focus on movies that didn't deliver on what the audiences were expecting at the time of release and can be more appreciated now at a later time/with an outsider perception. Idk if I explained that well enough so here are a couple of my own examples...

When The Happening (2008) came out, I remember everyone was hyped for the new M. Night Shyamalan horror movie. They were let down by how bad it was in just about every way, however, before I got to see it I had a buddy of mine tell me that it was the funniest thing he had ever seen. So I went into the movie expecting laughs, and to this day I recommend it to people as a great comedy!

Speaking of comedies, they rarely make as big of a splash as The Hangover did when it was first released. And as per usual, it led to a couple of disappointing sequels. I strongly disliked the Hangover 2 for being TOO similar to the first movie so I skipped the third one entirely when it came out. On a random boring weekend, I saw the Hangover part 3 playing on HBO years after its release so I gave it a chance. It had been awhile since I had seen any of the Hangover movies so jumping right into the third one randomly like that helped me to separate it from the trilogy altogether. I didn't expect to laugh at all because I had remembered hearing that it wasn't funny, so I found myself actually appreciating it for the crime thriller it was trying to be. Also, I could sorta see the leading up to the Todd Phillips who made Joker with the darker side of Hangover 3.

#Optimal Use
This subreddit shouldn't be used for reviews, blindly suggesting lists of movies or just asking for generally universal acclaimed films. Google can easily supply all of those answers. The best way to use this subreddit is understanding that you're leveraging crowdsourcing to identify an itch to scratch. If you don't know specifically what you're looking for, then a Googled question will answer you.

You can easily find top Sci-Fi, Horror, Drama and all of the genres with a search. Someone has already asked and answered so many common requests: Top Korean New Wave, Grounded Science Fiction, Universally Acclaimed Movies, Specific Types of Horror or Thrillers; and so much more. The optimal use of this subreddit is when your question requires a human intelligence. Each time you ask for a movie to watch, the replies will be tailored *exactly for you*. Give as much detail as possible for what you're looking for and you'll be surprised at some of the answers.

#If you think you have a generic question, check [the FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MovieSuggestions/wiki/index#wiki_faq).

This subreddit is not useful for:

- Identifying a Movie: Use /r/tipofmytongue 
- Requesting a TV Series: Use /r/televisionsuggestions 
- Suggest the Creation of a Movie: Use /r/pitchamovie or /r/scriptprompts 
- Asking for How a Scene Was Created: Use /r/Filmmakers 
- Hawking Your Blog/App/Review/YouTube: There's plenty of *other* subreddits for all of these activities.

If you've begun to trust this community with their picks, we do have plenty of Monthly Round-ups of Best Movies:

If you want a quick reply, such as ""What to Watch Tonight"", your best bet is to use our Discord: https://discord.gg/r5tDTrE

It would also be a great way to talk to other cinephiles who are looking for more than the stock answers to every question.

# Barred Suggestions
Barred movies mean that no one should use them as a Suggestion. You can definitely reply to a post if someone wants a movie that suits it. These are films that come up so frequently in post discussions that the community at large is aware about their existence and posting about them is just pandering.

Barred Suggests| | | |
---|---|----|----
12 Angry Men (1957)|Coherence|Donnie Darko|Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind|
John Wick|Knives Out|The Man from Earth|Oldboy (2003)|
Parasite (2019)|The Prestige|Train to Busan|Upgrade|
Whiplash|

&lt;p&gt;If you want a quick reply, such as &amp;quot;What to Watch Tonight&amp;quot;, your best bet is to use our Discord: &lt;a href=""https://discord.gg/r5tDTrE""&gt;https://discord.gg/r5tDTrE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would also be a great way to talk to other cinephiles who are looking for more than the stock answers to every question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Barred Suggestions&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barred movies mean that no one should use them as a Suggestion. You can definitely reply to a post if someone wants a movie that suits it. These are films that come up so frequently in post discussions that the community at large is aware about their existence and posting about them is just pandering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Barred Suggests&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;12 Angry Men (1957)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Coherence&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Donnie Darko&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;John Wick&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Knives Out&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The Man from Earth&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Oldboy (2003)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Parasite (2019)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The Prestige&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Train to Busan&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Upgrade&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Whiplash&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td colspan=""3"" &gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pro Tip&lt;/strong&gt;: This means these movies are &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; good and you should probably check them out.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm looking for films about characters being nostalgic about happy moments in their past and a lost/far away life. It's a bonus if the film can feature moving flashbacks.

The film that comes to my mind is [The Diving Bell and the Butterfly (2007)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Diving_Bell_and_the_Butterfly_(film)) which tells the true story of a former french fashion journalist who becomes fully paralyzed and can only move one eye after an accident. The film focuses on his current struggle and his happy memories and while it sounds like a sad story I don't think the film was that sad.

[Blue Jasmine (2013)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Jasmine) by Woody Allen is another great example of what I'm looking for.

,MovieSuggestions,"Hi all,

I'm after suggestions for modern Sci-Fi movies that try to be accurate to the science - or at least plausible to what our current understanding of the Universe says.

A perfect example being ""Interstellar"" and it's portrayal of General Relativity, Time Dilation &amp; Interstellar wormhole travel - this being largely due to the involvement of theoretical physicist, Kip Thorne.

Or ""Contact"", which was adapted from the book written by arguably one of the best-known scientists of the 20th century, Carl Sagan.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't mind a bit of artistic license where it makes sense, for example the inconsistent gravity in ""The Martian"", where it was accurate to Mars when he's outside (approx. 40% of Earth) yet Earth-like when he's in the hab - apparently this was a creative decision as it looked too jarring when Matt Damon's character wasn't in his suit.

On the other hand, space fire that acts like it does on earth, despite being in a vacuum, is particularly annoying.

I get no movie is perfect and mostly get some things right, some wrong, i.e... ""Gravity"" and it's accurate portrayal of fire, but it changes the orbits of the ISS and Hubble telescope to be next to each other?

&amp;#x200B;

Whilst I do enjoy them the most, it doesn't necessarily have to be space-based as movies like ""Arrival"" are just as fascinating where Amy Adams' character never leaves the ground.

&amp;#x200B;

If any one has any good time travel movies, I'll take those too. Especially those that explore the relationship between time, space and gravity.

Or, anything about the block universe theory, or 4th dimensional travel.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance.

,MovieSuggestions,"Hi! 

My partner and I watch a film every Friday night. We started back in July to try and help with the boredom of lockdown. It's a no phone zone and something to look forward to in the week. I pick a movie one Friday and she picks the movie the following Friday.

It's my turn this week and I'm running out of ideas but thought I'd ask for a suggestion. I like most genres but really fancy a Thriller/Horror/Mystery type film at the moment. For Horrors I would love a genuinely terrifying one but I'm also a big fan of that uneasy certain films give you (Get Out, Us etc).

I'll list the films we watched and our marks out of 10 to give an idea of what we have seen. I'll refer to us as Me &amp; Her :D Hopefully this can also act as a decent suggestion guide as well.

,MovieSuggestions,"Had great help rediscovering this movie over at r/tipofmytongue. And an extra tip about Lassiter.

Probably due to everything being more exciting and surprising when I was young, and me getting older, I am starting too feel that ""they just don't make them like they used to"". There are still great movies made today but specifically when it comes to high adventure movies we just don't get them that much anymore.

Basically I miss Dino De Laurentiis...

Movies like Conan, King Kong (with Jeff)and Dune, among plenty of others, I feel have this larger than life production value to them. The same thing with High Road To China as I remember it from my youth (I'm doing a Tom Selleck marathon soon to rewatch it). These movies didn't always have the best acting or plot, but they are always incredibly enjoyable to watch over and over again. There are some more modern equivalents like the first The Mummy movie, Prisoner Of Azkaban, Big Fish and Stardust, that I have really enjoyed, but I feel more time is passing between each one. Sure we got the Marvel universe with some great movies but they are often too long, just to squeeze in 20 plot lines linking to other upcoming movies, and I just don't get the same feeling as I do from the stand alone movies.

&lt;p&gt;Probably due to everything being more exciting and surprising when I was young, and me getting older, I am starting too feel that &amp;quot;they just don&amp;#39;t make them like they used to&amp;quot;. There are still great movies made today but specifically when it comes to high adventure movies we just don&amp;#39;t get them that much anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically I miss Dino De Laurentiis...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Movies like Conan, King Kong (with Jeff)and Dune, among plenty of others, I feel have this larger than life production value to them. The same thing with High Road To China as I remember it from my youth (I&amp;#39;m doing a Tom Selleck marathon soon to rewatch it). These movies didn&amp;#39;t always have the best acting or plot, but they are always incredibly enjoyable to watch over and over again. There are some more modern equivalents like the first The Mummy movie, Prisoner Of Azkaban, Big Fish and Stardust, that I have really enjoyed, but I feel more time is passing between each one. Sure we got the Marvel universe with some great movies but they are often too long, just to squeeze in 20 plot lines linking to other upcoming movies, and I just don&amp;#39;t get the same feeling as I do from the stand alone movies.&lt;/p&gt;

I just finished watching wild child  emma roberts ( very old movie i know 😳) i was in very bad mood and remembered this movie,  which was a part of my childhood that i miss soo much....i used to be so obsessed with it 😅🙃  i watched it so many times i can't even count 🙈

And then i just realized that it's really been sooo long since i really loved and enjoyed a movie so much ..maybe because i'v been readig books more then watching movies. Or that i still can't find something really REALLY enjoyable...

Anyway what i want to ask u is if u could recommend me some movies similar to "" wild child"" ?  u know where the girl is so spoiled and rich then something happens and she ends up in a different situation,  and make new friends and finds her true love ❤

There was another movie similar to it too ""from prada to nada"" ( except she didn't really find new friends )

Maybe like an amusing action movie, that is well respected for being exactly that and nothing more. Like John-Wick vibe.

The films you might suggest don't necessarily have to be from that era though, but there's something about the films I mentioned above that make them look bright, somewhat low-def, grainy and dream-like that I also quite enjoy (maybe a combination of the lighting, cameras and film used being particular to the era?

&lt;p&gt;Other than that, I don’t know what makes 42nd street and Singing in the Rain so much more appealing, but some recommendations that are similar would be nice.&lt;/p&gt;

I define good movies to be 8+ or if you abhor grades, the top 20% of movies you've ever seen. Films listed here will be added to the subreddit's [Top 100](https://www.reddit.com/r/MovieSuggestions/wiki/meta/top100). What are the top films you saw in February 2021 and why?  Here are my picks:

# Song of the Sea (2014)

Song of the Sea eventually won me over. I initially didn't like the art style and I found the child protagonists to be grating. Gradually, I was entranced by Song's style but my focus was more on the story. Irish mythology is woefully underrepresented in media, so it was amazing to see it committed to screen. As soon as the tale abandoned the childish sibling rivalry and focused on myth, Song of the Sea turned into an excellent adventure movie.

I watched **Nell (1994)** where Jodie Foster plays a feral child who's invented her own language and has had no communication with the outside world. I thought that movie's premise was interesting and thought-provoking even if the actual movie slid too far into melodrama. I also watched **The Miracle Worker (1962)** after that about Helen Keller and how Helen was taught to communicate or to understand words. That movie was a lot more concise and clean in executing its goals than Nell was and I thought The Miracle Worker did a good job getting across the gist of how H.K. was taught to communicate. I also watched Room a few years ago and it was cool/i think it fits here..even if that movie was more about the emotions of the characters than the psychological/philosophical side of things.

Anyway, I'd be interested in seeing any more movies about feral children or people who have their own language which other people try to decipher/understand..or about people who have a limited understanding of the outside world and how they perceive the world as a result. I plan to watch **Truffaut's The Wild Child (1970)**, and I may watch **Mockingbird Don't Sing (2001)** which was based on the real life case of Genie Wiley....but aside from that nothing appeals to me/fits my needs. I also wouldn't mind if the characters are adults rather than children or if they're not physically cut off/isolated but only isolated and cut off in a sensory way..or if they're just perfectly healthy people cut off who are cut off from civilisation rather than disabled people.

There's a lot of class to Costner's performance and I'd recommend seeing this if you want to see a great actor delivering great acting in general. He's supported nicely by William Hurt who is having a blast as an anonymous phycological parasite.

Moore is a cop who suspects something isn't quite right in suburbia, and she ain't wrong. There's a serial killer around but he's hiding inside a veil of respectability and polish. And how *do* you catch someone hiding inside someone else.

,MovieSuggestions,"Whilst searching on streaming services (Netflix/Amazon Instant Video), more often than not, we've just ended up watching a lot of mediocre stuff that's mainly marketed at children and therefore doesn't appeal to me as all that interesting or engaging, for example:

* Benji
* Pets United  \[**awful**\]
* Beethoven
* Pee Wee's Big Holiday
* Storks
* Christmas Break In \[**awful\]**
* The Queen's Corgi  \[**awful\]**
* The BFG (2016)
* Johnny English 1/Reborn/ Strikes Again
* The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas
* Nativity 2: Danger in the Manger \[**awful\]**
* Gnomeo &amp; Juliet/Sherlock Gnomes
* 48 Christmas Wishes \[**awful\]**
* Paul Blart: Mall Cop
* Richie Rich

However, we have discovered some gems that we've all really enjoyed:

* Hugo
* Lala Land
* The usual Pixar stuff (Incredibles, Ratatouille, Toy Story etc.)
* Shrek/Shrek 2
* Groundhog Day
* Matilda
* Coming to America (me and my Dad both really enjoyed it, but my Mum left the room due to all the F words!)
* Shaun the Sheep: Farmageddon

Likewise we've watched some stuff, which I've quite enjoyed, but neither of my parents liked:

* Coco
* Labyrinth
* Casino Royale
* The Hunger Games: Catching Fire

**My Dad** likes: heart-warming tales, light-heartedness, and dislikes themes of dystopia, darkness, violence or corruption as it makes him become cynical about human nature. He also doesn't like fast moving giddy action films as he can't keep up with them. He is highly empathic and so has a very strong sensory reaction to situations which are depicted on screen: even though they aren't real, I think he experiences them in his mind as if they *are* real.

**My Mum** likes: musicals, costume dramas, and especially dislikes films which are morally dubious with excessive swearing, sex or violence in. She also dislikes films which are not rooted firmly in the real world or that have complicated and deep storylines that one cannot keep up with, as they make her head hurt.

**I like:** films which make you think or which have deep, complex and interlocking storylines. I like to be on the edge of my seat whether that be through white-knuckle peril, or a deep mystery. I have great admiration for the fantastic, the mystical, the non-linear, and for sci-fi. I particularly enjoy thrillers and physiological thrillers. I also have time for genuinely well-made movies of any genre, which stimulate one's emotions in a mature and adult way.

So you can see how we are the direct opposite in terms of our tastes in movies! So based on this, can you recommend me some good movies, which are maturely made and stimulating, but that are not too morally dubious, and that we'd all enjoy.

Plot subversions always help, too, so long as they fit within the universe and characters.

Liked (In no particular order):
-Uncut Gems
-Parasite
-Argo

-Arrival
-The Gentlemen
-Kingsman
-Nightcrawler

Neutral on:
-Tenet
-Bad Boys III (Really, this was a terrible movie, but somehow it was so bad that I kinda like it? Like a guilty pleasure.)
-Boys State
-Bad Education
-The Gift (Good movie, but a little scary/sad for my partner)

Disliked:
-The Nest (wtf was this?)
-The Matrix (hot take, I know, but I'd argue it has all the issues I mentioned above)
-High Life (couldn't hear or understand the main character, fell asleep 25 minutes in)

&lt;p&gt;And quite a few other mind bending noir style movies. Im hoping some ones i havent seen pop up here. Bonus points if the endings are well done. Just watched Only God Forgives and if its ending wasnt shit, it would have gone on this list. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry i cant be more specific with what im looking for. Thanks in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

,MovieSuggestions,"Hi :) my fiancé and I are currently watching Knives Out and I think I’m enjoying it (seeming like a cop out ending). And cluedo is one of my favourite games 😍 can anyone recommend any good “whodunnit” movies (without lame copouts please!!!!) or just more mystery (eg. Gone girl). I love this movie, I think it was called hide and seek maybe, where a girl gets married and that night they all start trying to kill her because of a “game” before she escapes. Well I should say liked because the supernatural crap ruined it for me. 

Any and all recommendations are welcome :) obviously no spoilers please :p 

I’m in Australia and have Stan, Netflix and Amazon Prime. But if a movie sounds really great then I’m happy to pay a few dollars to buy or rent it online :)


Edit: I just finished the movie Knives Out and it was amazing!!
